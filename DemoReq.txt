Good day, @everyone. Just a reminder that for Exam presentations demonstrations, you will be presenting to another academic who does
not know anything about your system so you must adequately explain your problem and solution. You should have a slideshow to do this.

- The slideshow should be about 5-10 minutes (max 15 in general)
- Ideally, it should briefly describe the problem and fully explain your solution and it's performance
- Include an illustration of your model(s)/approaches
- Clearly indicate the use of libraries
- Explain what you have done and what still needs to be done
- Include results/performance (preferably visualised). Ideally comparing your results with those of with state-of-the-art approches

For the demo:

- You do not need to train ML models (but should be able to)
- Show an example prediction/classification - generally the full use case of your system from a user pov
- Describe what your code does at a high level (may be done as algorithm in presentation)
- Be able to answer question regarding your code line-by-line
