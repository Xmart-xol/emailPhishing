To: iuxxdkqk@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz Message-ID: 	 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=""iso-8859-1"" Dear all, I wonder which Weka algorithm could perform a mountain clustering in an spatial grid, in other words, having the coordinates of a map (x,y ... or even more) and then the altitude/height at each point I would like to localise the peaks of that topological surface. Which Weka algorithm can perform this? I see it as a clustering problem where the peak should be at the center of each cluster.

(which means that the serialized classifier DOES NOT re-run the attribute selection filter on the new data, just uses the selection of attributes learnt during the training stage). -----Original Message----- From: ""Fabio Cerqueira""  To: ""Weka machine learning workbench list.""

Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence
Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain, April 3-5, 2006
http://www.mdai.info/mdai2006

AIMS AND GOALS:

Decision making processes, and information fusion tools at large, are 
currently embedded in most Artificial Intelligence applications. As a 
consequence, systems based on decision making and fusion techniques are 
becoming pervasive. They are currently in use in all kind of environments, 
from entertainment gadgets to safety-critical or risk management software. 

MDAI (Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence) conferences were 
initiated (Barcelona, 2004; Tsukuba, 2005) with the aim of providing a 
forum to researchers for discussing models for decision and information 
fusion (aggregation operators) as well as computational methods and 
criteria for model selection and determination. 

PUBLICATION: 

Proceedings with accepted papers will be published in the LNAI/LNCS series
(Springer-Verlag), and distributed at the conference (MDAI 2004 and MDAI
2005 proceedings were published in LNCS/LNAI volumes 3131, and 3558,
respectively). Besides, papers, that according to the evaluation of the
referees, are not suitable for the LNAI but that have some merits will be
published in separate conference proceedings (CD-ROM, ISBN 84-00-08306-7,
in MDAI 2005).

DEADLINES: 
 Submission deadline: October 7, 2005 
 Acceptance notification: December 13, 2005 
 Final version of accepted papers: December 23, 2005 
 Conference: April 3-5, 2006

Venue: Tarragona (100km south of Barcelona, on the Mediterranean sea) with
its mild climate, its broad and clean beaches of fine sand, and its
significant artistic and architectural heritage make Tarragona one of
Europe's main tourist attractions. 

The city was the capital of the Roman province of Hispania Citerior (2000
years ago), and the Roman archaeological complex is now a World Heritage
Site (UNESCO, 2000).

The region is also well known for its gastronomy and also for its wines.
When gastronomy is mentioned in Tarragona, it is usually a reference to
sea-food. Reus (a nearway city) is the home town of Antoni Gaudi.

FROM THE EDITOR



What do your customers need?
[by Lauren Hoyt]
kemec@techtarget.com

  Today's customers, with greater access to information have greater expectations and demand more from the companies they have a business relationship with, often making it difficult to properly serve their needs. 

That's a challenge faced by one SearchCRM.com reader -- Aanchal -- who sought the advice of our customer experience management expert Lior Arussy, asking, ""In your opinion, what are the basic needs of today's customers?""

Lior's answer sheds some light on the customer experience management trend. According to Arussy, customers who are calling a call center with a problem have six basic needs:  

Agents who can make decisions: Customers want to talk to an empowered call center agent who has the authority to help solve their problems.
Knowledgeable agents: Customers want call center agents to be prepared with information so the customer doesn't need to provide it repeatedly. 
First call resolution: Customers want their problems resolved as quickly as possible. 
Respect: Customers want to be treated with respect and do not want to be taken for granted. 
Empathy: Customers want to talk to a kind and understanding human being. 
Fair resolution: Customers want the resolution to be fair; not arbitrary or one-sided.

Do you agree with Lior? Is this what customers need? Is anything missing from this list? Write and let me know. And be sure to browse the rest of our expert section or submit your own question to Lior or another expert. 

Until next time,

Ah but doing things like splitting giant files is trivial on Linux..

If only you could remember the arcane Linux/UNIX incantation. I'd ask 
about splitting files on a Linux list in preference to anyplace else.
Also MySQL was mentioned, which is NORMALLY a Linux jobbie.

I'd not think about asking about XP here. The lads here still probably 
prefer vi to Textpad or nano.

+
+ThunderBayes (http://pieces.openpolitics.com/thunderbayes/) is an extension

Well, I'd see no reason to change the call syntax unless we allow ""x,
y, *z"" elsewhere, and conversely once we allow the latter, not fixing
calls would be a mistake. So even if they don't share much code, they
go hand in hand for me.

Oh, I agree (it's an invaluable trick for things like ""from 
_hidden_module import *""). I was just speculating on how the module 
level variant may have come to be broken in the first place, not 
suggesting that the breakage was intentional or a good idea. My 
curiousity isn't strong enough to get me to trawl through the svn 
history to find out the actual cause though ;)

Cheers,

Hi.
 
I’m interested in the AJAX
SlideShow-control.
Is there a way to make some sort of
album-control or do you have something similar already?
Would be great to have an album (I’ve
got about 2000 images on my personal site) and when choosing one of the albums
you’ll get an overview, and when clicking a photo it’ll popup with
your control.
 
Cheers

I guess we're going to have to agree to disagree.  I find hiding directories
which contain executable code extremely non-obvious.  Would you prefer
/usr/.local to /usr/local?  If not, then why prefer ~/.local to ~/local?

And there's this:

perl -wle 'package A; sub foo {""foo""}; package B; @ISA = qw(A); sub foo; package main; print B->foo'
Undefined subroutine &B::foo called at -e line 1.

versus this:
perl -wle 'package A; sub foo {""foo""}; package B; @ISA = qw(A); package main; print B->foo'
foo

Which you don't want to break by mistake.

It's great being the quiz man because everyone loves to find errors.
Apparently Song For Guy has words so last week's theme wasn't really

Well the empty password seems to work. Does the above query return no
rows or an empty row?

Your query perhaps returns an empty value for missing users rather than
no result, or the SASL SQL driver or plugin for LOGIN is broken.

****************************************
AIME'05


. CALL FOR PARTICIPATION




for the Tenth Conference on
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine

July 23 - 27, 2005, Aberdeen, UK
www.csd.abdn.ac.uk/aime05

Co-located with IJCAI-2005
****************************************



The European Society for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIME), was 
established in

1986 with two main goals: 1) to foster fundamental and applied research in the

application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to medical care and 
medical

research, and 2) to provide a forum for reporting significant results 
achieved at

biennial conferences. Additionally, AIME assists medical industrialists to 
identify new

AI techniques with high potential for integration into new products. A 
major activity of

this society has been a series of international conferences, from Marseille 
(FR) in 1987

to Protaras, Cyprus in 2003, held biennially over the last 18 years.

The AIME'05 conference will be a unique opportunity to present and improve the

international state of the art of AI in Medicine from both a research and an

applications perspective. For this purpose, AIME'05 will include invited 
lectures,

contributed full and short papers, system demonstrations, tutorials, and 
workshops.

Ontology Mapping: A Way out of the Medical Tower of Babel?

Dealing with large amounts of heterogeneous data is one of the crucial 
challenges in

modern Computer Science, and Medical Informatics is no exception: handling 
patient data

from different sources, searching through large volumes of research 
literature, and

integrating information systems all require that we are able to integrate 
data from very

different sources using very different vocabularies.

In recent years, ontologies have been touted as a new and promising 
solution to this old

problem: hierarchically organised, shared vocabularies that formalise the 
semantics of

terms. The promise is that mapping between such ontologies provides a 
solution to

dealing with heterogeneous data-sources.

In this talk I will survey different approaches to ontology-mapping, covering

linguistic, statistical and logical methods. The state of the art will be 
illustrated

through a number of recent applications that employ ontology mappings, 
specifically in

the medical domain. At the end of the talk, we should hopefully have an 
answer if, and

to what extent ontology mapping is our way out of the terminological tower 
of Babel.

Bio: Frank van Harmelen is professor in Knowledge Representation and 
Reasoning at the

Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. He was awarded a PhD from the Department of 
AI in

Edinburgh for his research on meta-level reasoning, after having studied 
Mathematics and

Computer Science in Amsterdam. His research is in the modelling and 
representation of

different forms of knowledge and reasoning, as found in a large variety of 
AI systems,

with an interest in both applications and theory. He has made key 
contributions to the

CommonKADS methodology for developing knowledge-based system by providing a 
formal basis

for the conceptual models. In recent years, he has been very active in 
developments

around the Semantic Web. One of his five books is the first text book on 
Semantic Web

technology. He is involved in numerous European Semantic Web projects, and 
he was one of

the designers of the W3C standard ontology language OWL. He was the Program 
Chair of the

ECAI 2002, the General Chair of the 2004 International Semantic Web 
Conference, and will

chair the Semantic Web track of the 2005 World Wide Web conference.

Human Computer Interaction in Context-Aware Wearable Systems

Today in nearly any situation there is guaranteed to be a piece of useful 
information

somewhere on the network. It includes such trivial everyday things like 
restaurant menus

and transportation delays, building plans (relevant for rescue personnel), 
patient

records (needed for example by emergency medics) and multimedia manuals 
(for maintenance

and assembly work). However today most people use their connected devices 
predominantly

for conventional telephony, email access, scheduling and an occasional 
photograph.

Despite a strong push by service providers accessing online information in 
a mobile

environment is still the exception.

To a large degree the limited use of mobile connected devices can be 
attributed to the

inadequacies of the current interaction paradigm. The talk will describe a 
new approach

to solving this problem: so called context-aware wearable systems. Such 
systems attempt

to automatically recognize the needs of the user and deliver the correct 
information at

the correct time and place in a discrete, non-disturbing way. In the 
simplest case the

context used to model the users needs system might be just time and 
location. In more

advanced applications it would include user activity (walking, standing, 
going to work,

performing a particular maintenance task), environment state (e.g 
examination of a

specific patient) and background information such as the users schedule or 
habits. In

the talk our work on context recognizing using simple sensors (accelerometers,

unltrasonic location, microphones etc.) mounted in the users outfit and 
the environment

will be presented. Specific applications from health care related areas 
will be

discussed.

Bio: Paul Lukowicz holds a MSc in Computer Science, and MSc in Physics and 
an Ph.D in

Computer Science all from the University of Karlsruhe, Germany. From 1999 
till 2003 he

was a senior researcher at the ETH Zürich in charge of the wearable Computing

Laboratory. Since 2003 he has been Professor of Computer Engineering the 
University for

Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology in Hall (Insbruck) in 
Austria. His

research interest include ubiquitous system architectures, context 
awareness and novel

applications enabled by the two, with an emphasis on healthcare related 
areas. He has

also worked on parallel computing systems and optical interconnects. Paul 
Lukowicz is

active in a number of European Union sponsored research project.

Georg Brandl <splmn@python.org>,zttpnd-wnlugsli@python.org,"Tue, 05 Aug 2008 23:01:48 +0100","Public release of Sphinx, Python's documentation toolchain","I'm delighted to announce that the Sphinx library, used to build the
new Python documentation (for 2.6 and 3.0) [1], is now released for
general use.


What is it?
===========

Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful
documentation for Python projects (or other documents consisting of
multiple reStructuredText source files).

Its website is at .


What does it do?
================

Sphinx is not an API documentation generator like Epydoc.  Instead, its
focus is on hand-written documentation, such as the Python one.

* Main output formats: HTML (including HTML Help) and LaTeX

* Extensive cross-references: semantic markup and automatic links
   for functions, classes, glossary terms and similar pieces of information

* Hierarchical structure: easy definition of a document tree, with
   automatic links to siblings, parents and children

* Automatic indices: general index as well as a module index

* Code handling: automatic highlighting using the Pygments highlighter

* Goodies such as changes overview, and external link checking


What else?
==========

Various extensions are available and in development:

* autodoc: pulls in documentation from docstrings that are written in
   reST, to avoid having to maintain multiple documentation locations

* doctest: automatically tests snippets in the documentation in doctest
   fashion

* coverage: documentation coverage checker


Cheers,
Georg

WWW::Mechanize::Shell has a failure on 5.10-to-be, but the same test 
works on 5.8.8 [1]. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to whittle down 
the test to something manageable that still exhibits the failure 
behaviour, and I've already spent the evening with that.

So, I beseech you to run a binary search when the test starts failing in 
the hope that the patch reason hints at the deeper cause of the test 
failures.

A bit of the situation:

The W:M:S code wraps LWP::UserAgent::request using Hook::LexWrap.
The logging code in W:M:S is overwritten from the test program, to 
instrument it.

On the first round, it all works, LWP::UserAgent::request is called and 
the wrapping logging code in W:M:S resp. the instrumented test code are 
called. (Test 6)

On the second round, the wrapped LWP::UserAgent::request still gets 
called, but the test instrumentation code isn't, anymore. (Test 14)

All my attempts to recreate this separately in a nice self-contained 
file have been in vain, and the same code has been working for a long 
time under 5.8.x, so I'm at a loss as to what's wrong with it under 
5.10-to-be ...

=====================================================================

		     CALL FOR TUTORIAL PROPOSALS

  The International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling
			      ICAPS 2007
		    Providence, Rhode Island, USA
			September 22--26, 2007
		     icaps07.icaps-conference.org

		      Co-located event: CP 2007
=====================================================================


The Organizing Committee of the 17th International Conference on
Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS 2007) invites tutorial
proposals.  Tutorials (and workshops) will be held on September 22nd
and 23rd, immediately prior to the conference plenary sessions and
concurrently with the 13th International Conference on the Principles
and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP 2007), with which ICAPS
2007 is co-located.

We invite proposals for half-day or full-day tutorials on automated
planning and scheduling research and applications; for example, space
systems, manufacturing, robotics, disaster relief, and crisis
response.  We also invite tutorials on relevant topics in related
areas, such as constraints, control, diagnosis, learning, operations
research, search, software engineering.  Tutorial registration is free
for ICAPS 2007 participants.

The topics of the tutorials of the last ICAPS conference covered
subsea robotics, filtering techniques, meta-heuristics for scheduling
problems, complexity of planning, off-line ground planning and on-line
on-board planning, planning graph based reachability heuristics and
multiagent planning and scheduling.

Tutorials should be designed to provide a comprehensive and in-depth
perspective of some aspect of the state of the art in planning and
scheduling research or applications.  Ideally, they should be
accessible to an audience of AI researchers while offering interesting
insights to experts in the specific field.  If you have any questions
about the suitability of a particular tutorial topic please do not
hesitate to contact the tutorial chairs.

IMPORTANT DATES:

   Deadline for proposal submission:   March 30, 2007
   Acceptance notification:            April 27, 2007

AIMS and SCOPE

Evolutionary algorithms based on probabilistic models (EAPM) have
been recognized as a new computing paradigm in evolutionary
computation. There is no traditional crossover or mutation in
EAPMs. Instead, they explicitly extract global statistical
information from their previous searches and build a probability
distribution model of promising solutions, based on the extracted
information. New solutions are then sampled from the model thus
built. Instances of EAPMs include estimation of distribution
algorithms, probabilistic model building genetic algorithms, ant
colony optimization, and the cross entropy method, to name just a
few.  Recent years have seen a growing interest in the research
and application of EAPMs.  As an interdisciplinary research area,
the development of EAPMs needs joint effort from researchers and
practitioners in evolutionary computation, machine learning,
statistics and simulation. The aim of this special issue is to be
a milestone event in the development of EAPMs, which will
highlight the recent development of EAPMs, clarify outstanding
issues for future progress, and disseminate EAPMs to a wider
audience to attract more researchers to EAPMs.

TOPICS COVERED

Suggested topics include (but are not limited to) the following:
     *Theory of EAPMs,
     *New EAPMs,
     *Combination of machine learning techniques and EAPMs,
     *Combination of statistics techniques and EAPMs,
     *Combination of other heuristics and EAPMs,
     *EAPMs for multiobjective optimization problems,
     *EAPMs in dynamic and noisy environments,
     *Parallel implementation of EAPMs,
     *Real-world/novel applications.

The 2007 International Conference on Machine Learning: Models,
Technologies & Applications (MLMTA'07) will be held in Las Vegas,
Nevada, June 25-28, 2007.


MLMTA'07 aims to bring together researches from computer science, applied
statistics, applied mathematics and engineering working in the field of
Machine Learning. In addition to traditional topics in development and
application of statistical methods in data analysis MLMTA'07 has this year
a special focus on methods utilizing the 'systems view' of a problem. Due
to the fact that graph-based methods have proven to be an useful
mathematical representation of problems in this class submitted papers
developing or applying graph-based statistical methods are of utmost
interest.

               [apologies for multiple copies] 
 
                Ninth International Conference on 
               Deontic Logic in Computer Science
                          (DEON'08)
  
                  Luxembourg, 15-18 July, 2008

                       Call for Papers

The biennial DEON conferences are designed to promote interdisciplinary
cooperation amongst scholars interested in linking the formal-logical
study of normative concepts and normative systems with computer science,
artificial intelligence, philosophy, organisation theory and law. In
addition to these general themes, DEON2008 will encourage a special
focus on the topic *Security and Trust*.

There have been eight previous DEON conferences: Amsterdam, December
1991; Oslo, January 1994; Sesimbra, January 1996; Bologna, January 1998;
Toulouse, January 2000; London, May 2002; Madeira, May 2004; Utrecht,
July 2006. Selected papers from each of these conferences have been
published internationally .


                        General themes

The Program Committee invites papers concerned with the following topics:

    * the logical study of normative reasoning, including formal systems
      of deontic logic, defeasible normative reasoning, the logic of
      action, and other related areas of logic
    * the formal analysis of normative concepts and normative systems
    * the formal representation of legal knowledge
    * the formal specification of aspects of norm-governed multi-agent
      systems and autonomous agents, including (but not limited to) the
      representation of rights, authorisation, delegation, power,
      responsibility and liability
    * the formal specification of normative systems for the management
      of bureaucratic processes in public or private administration
    * applications of normative logic to the specification of database
      integrity constraints
    * normative aspects of protocols for communication, negotiation and
      multi-agent decision making


                     Specific Security and Trust themes

DEON2008 has a special focus on logical approaches to deontic notions in
computer science in security and trust, encompassing applications in
e-commerce as well as traditional areas of computer security. Topics of
interest in this special theme include, but are not limited to:

    * digital rights management
    * electronic contracts, including:
          o service level agreements
          o digital media licenses
    * authorization
    * access control
    * security policies
    * privacy policies
    * business processes
    * regulatory compliance

We welcome both theoretical work (formal models, representations,
specifications, logics, verification) and implementation-oriented work
(architectures, programming languages, design models, simulations,
prototype systems) on these specific topics.


                         Submission details

Authors are invited to submit an original, previously unpublished,
research paper pertaining to any of these topics. The paper should be in
English, and should be no longer than 15 pages, or approximately 7500
words. The first page should contain the full name and contact
information for at least one of the authors, and it should contain an
abstract of no more than ten lines. Authors should submit their papers
electronically, in either .pdf or .ps format.

Authors should consult the instructions on the website
 for submitting their papers
electronically. (Anyone who is unable to send the paper electronically
and wishes to submit hard copies should inquire for details from one of
the program co-chairs at the addresses given below.) Authors are
especially encouraged to use the Springer LNCS styles if possible; these
are available at http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html. The
deadline for submission is 11 January 2008.


                            Timetable

    * 11 January 2008: submission deadline
    * 22 February 2008: notification of acceptance
    * 21 March 2008: deadline for final, camera-ready versions
    * 15 July 2008: NORMAS 2008 workshop
    * 16-18 July 2008: DEON'08 conference


                          Publication

Copies of the workshop proceedings, will be provided to all
participants. The proceedings will be published with Springer in their
LNCS/LNAI series. In addition, revised versions of selected papers from

My bad, just wanted to show that traffic should go on port 80, so what I 
actually do is just open http://domainname.

Indeed, the portnumber is the problem, it should just stay 
http://domainname instead of the http://domainname:8000.
I haven't touched the $config_base_location yet, but I'll look for it 
and try to modify it to see if that changed anything.

I don't know where SM gets that portnumber, but on my local apache2, 
everything is configured on port 8000, nothing runs on port 80 locally. 
Shouldn't have to be a problem though, right? The strange thing is that 
it only seems to be happening after pressing 'send'.

I've actually been running this set of 5 rules on several of the ISP 
mail systems I've got my fingers in (watch for line wrap, sorry):

# ""Nice girl"" wants to send pics, but only if you email the address in 
the body
# start scoring at .5, see how that whacks'em.
body NICE_GIRL_01       /Hello! I am (?:bored|tired) (?:today|this 
(?:afternoon|evening)|tonight)\\./
describe NICE_GIRL_01   Nice girls don't spam
score NICE_GIRL_01      0.8
body NICE_GIRL_02       /I am nice girl that would like to chat with you\\./
describe NICE_GIRL_02   Nice girls don't spam
score NICE_GIRL_02      0.8
body NICE_GIRL_03       /Email me at [^\\s]{,74} only, because I am 
writing not from my personal email\\./
describe NICE_GIRL_03   Nice girls don't spam
score NICE_GIRL_03      0.8
# not actually the same spam, but same class/type
body NICE_GIRL_04       /I will respond right away and send a pic and 
some of my info right away/
score NICE_GIRL_04      0.8
describe NICE_GIRL_04   Nice girls don't spam
body NICE_GIRL_05       /Reply to  me and tell me about yourself if you 
want to chat/
score NICE_GIRL_05      0.8
describe NICE_GIRL_05   Nice girls don't spam

I've also bumped BAYES_99 to 4.8 (and IIRC bumped scores on BAYES_90 and 
BAYES_95 as well).  For some reason I've been too lazy to bother 
tracking down, I usually only see two rules hitting on these messages - 
more than enough to push them over the stock threshold of 5 (I've found 
it better to tune rules and Bayes than fiddle with the threshold score).

Yes, I had this problem.  The problem is that the client side doesn't 
automatically run start-statd as I believe it used to.

If you run this (as root), then the mounts will work fine.

There are a couple of open bugs on this in bugzilla.  One of them is

I think it can actually be simplified. I think maintaining binary
compatibility between 2.6 and earlier versions is hopeless anyway, so
we might as well just rename PyString to PyBytes in 2.6 and 3.0, and
have an extra set of macros so that code using PyString needs to be
recompiled but not otherwise touched. E.g.

typedef { ... } PyBytesObject;
#define PyStringObject PyBytesObject

. PyString_Type;
#define PyBytes_Type PyString_Type

Generics Fuel AIDS Program By SARAH LUECK
July 31, 2008; Page B5

WASHINGTON -- Companies that make generic drugs, many based in India, now
dominate President George W. Bush's program to provide AIDS treatment in
poor countries.

Generic drugs, copies or combinations of brand-name products, accounted for
57% of the $131 million the U.S. spent on the program in fiscal 2007,
according to the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator. In 2005,
generics accounted for 11% of the program's funding. At that time, the U.S.
had approved few generics for the anti-AIDS initiative, so most of the money
went to buy brand-name drugs that are often more expensive.

Aurobindo Pharma Ltd., a generic-drug maker in India, was the biggest player
in fiscal 2007, which ended Sept. 30. The President's Emergency Plan for
AIDS Relief, or Pepfar, spent more than $39 million on Aurobindo Pharma
products to fight HIV and AIDS. India's Cipla Ltd. received more than $15
million, and Ranbaxy Laboratories, also in India, received nearly $9
million.

South Africa's Aspen Pharmacare
HoldingsLtd.
received nearly $13 million from Pepfar. It sells generic AIDS drugs
and, in some countries, produces brand-name products in partnership with Gilead
Sciences  Inc.
of Foster City, Calif.

Pepfar's shift to generics in the past two years followed a Bush
administration decision to set up a special approval at the Food and Drug
Administration for the drugs, which cannot be marketed in the U.S. because
of patent and exclusivity laws that protect the brand-name versions.

Pepfar provides treatment to patients in 15 poor countries, mostly in
sub-Saharan Africa. Bush officials came under fire when the program began
five years ago; activists and some in the generics industry complained that
the requirement for FDA approval skewed purchases toward more-expensive
brand-name products, meaning fewer people would be treated.

Wednesday, Mr. Bush signed a $48 billion, five-year expansion of the
program, which now draws widespread praise and is viewed as a major part of
his legacy. Congress must appropriate the funds, which also will go toward
treatment and prevention of malaria and tuberculosis.

""It's pretty clear that the system is working well, and it protects African
families just like American families are protected,"" said Ambassador Mark
Dybul, the U.S. global AIDS coordinator. ""We pretty methodically did what we
said we were going to do.""

Pepfar's spending on brand-name drugs totaled about $56 million in fiscal
year 2007, down from $106 million in 2005.
Merck& Co.
appeared to be the biggest recipient of funds in 2007, with nearly $16
million going to the Whitehouse Station, N.J.-based company.
GlaxoSmithKlinePLC
of the U.K. received about $12 million from Pepfar, including through
licensing agreements it has with makers of generics. Abbott
Laboratoriesof
Abbott Park, Ill., received nearly $9 million in 2007.

The generics companies have been pleased with the changes over the past two
years.

""Earlier, it did not work well because none of our products were approved,""
said Yusuf Hamied, Cipla's chairman and managing director. ""Now, there is
competition, and the money will be put to better use."" He said the funds
Cipla receives from Pepfar aren't significant from a business perspective,
but the company participates for humanitarian reasons and has helped build
pressure for brand-name-drug companies to lower their prices for poor
countries.

""The key is having affordable and accessible medicines, and I think the
generic industry has made a contribution in a very positive way to Pepfar,""
said Chuck Caprariello, a Ranbaxy spokesman.

This  issue is difficult to solve in DriverLoader but our developers are  working on this. Patching the kernel to export the symbol, like you did Bob, is probably  the most straightforward workaround at the moment but should only be  attempted by users which know what they are doing. Patching the kernel is not an ideal solution, hopefully something can be  done in DriverLoader itself to solve this problem.

And this, I was not able to compile it[1] until I changed it a little
bit[2].

[1] It was 6 errors, first and seconed line of the kind:
expertsample.cpp(85) : error C2440: 'initializing' : cannot convert from
'PyObject *' to 'PyFileObject *'
Types pointed to are unrelated; conversion requires reinterpret_cast,
C-style cast or function-style cast

And the remaining four of the kind:
expertsample.cpp(87) : error C2664: 'PySys_SetObject' : cannot convert
parameter 2 from 'PyFileObject *' to 'PyObject *'
Types pointed to are unrelated; conversion requires reinterpret_cast,
C-style cast or function-style cast

[2] So I changed the code to:

PyFileObject* xout = (PyFileObject*)PyFile_FromString(""CONOUT$"",""wb"");
PyFileObject* xin = (PyFileObject*)PyFile_FromString( ""CONIN$"", ""rb"" );
PySys_SetObject( ""stdout"", (PyObject*)xout ); PySys_SetObject( ""__stdout__"",
(PyObject*)xout ); PySys_SetObject( ""stdin"", (PyObject*)xin );
PySys_SetObject( ""__stdin__"", (PyObject*)xin );

But still no output after a PyRun_SimpleString(""print 'Hello from
python'\\n"");

How can it be ""tied closely to the OS"" without being tied
into the kernel.

The segmentation fault is because, in the exception handler, the current 
context used for an NCI call into the say method on ParrotIO (for example) 
has no calling context.

As to *why* that's happening, I'm not entirely sure.

I'm not aware of such a theme in SquirrelMail 1.4.8, which you seem to be
using. My guess is that you're using a modified installation. Find out who
modified the installation and ask him/her how to proceed.

If you're the administrator, please read the posting guidelines and
provide some more details: version, how you obtained and installed
SquirrelMail, how you choose the Outlook2003 theme etc.

My (very simplistic) answer is that it's whatever someone uses to
manage packages. What level of functionality it has is irrelevant, as
long as it suits an individual's way of working.

I hope I didn't say you had - but it is an often-raised point, and it
does grate on me (as by implication, it says that what I do isn't
""real"" package management). It's just another flavour of the old
Windows vs Linux OS wars, which I don't want to participate in :-)

Agreed. The minimal package manager on Windows is arguably reasonable
precisely because the standard layout doesn't require much more.

On the other hand, Microsoft has a bad habit of changing their
""standards"", and in particular Vista changes a lot of things. But
that's very off-topic, so I'll avoid going into detail here.

Precisely. I could argue that the Linix filesystem structure is over
complex, and causes the need for complex package managers, precisely
because it's impossible to manually keep track of what file is owned
by what package. But this way lies OS wars, so I won't make a major
point of this, but just ask that people consider it as a possibility.

(I believe that Mac OS X goes for an even simpler structure -
applications store *everything* in the one directory, so that
install/uninstall is simply a directory copy/remove. I won't comment
on what that proves...)

OK. I would, though, as I don't really want much more.

Later, you said:

> I just don't do Windows.  :-)

And you've been pretty clear that you're looking for information
rather than trying to explain how you think Windows should work. But
many people aren't so balanced in their views, and that makes it hard
to have a discussion - I'd suggest that people without Windows
experience leave the Windows side to the Windows people, and accept
that when they say ""XXX won't work for us"", that the statement is
probably true.

I find this whole discussion hugely confusing, because a lot of people
are stating opinions about environments which it seems they don't use,
or know much about. I don't know how to avoid this, but it does make
it highly unlikely that any practical progress will get made.

Paul.

Twinkle is a SIP application.

Is it really possible that no users of SuSE, or even of Linux, have 
thought to have the addressbook dial the telephone?

Conference on Modeling and Using Context (Denmark, 20-24 August 2007):

CHUT-07: Role of Contextualization in HUman Tasks: Enriching of Actors


CONTEXT-07: http://context-07.ruc.dk/CONTEXT07MainPage.html
Workshop:   http://www-poleia.lip6.fr/~jbrezillon/CHUT-07


     Paper submission to the workshop: May 28, 2007

The CHUT-07 workshop focuses on the process of contextualization in 
human tasks, including the actor accomplishing the task and the working 
place where this occurs. Thus, concrete aspects of context are 
considered at various levels from the knowledge representation to the 
reasoning modeling. The relationships between the task and the actor are 
considered in the context of the working place. Thus different types of 
context must be tackled, and the movement of the triple (actor, task and 
working place) across all the contexts supposes a process of 
contextualization.

The goal of the CHUT-07 workshop is to clarify the practical role of the 
contextualization with respect to the triple (actor, task and working 
place) in the real world.

                                     During ICML'2005
                             August 7, 2005. Bonn, Germany




DESCRIPTION
-----------
Many real-life applications may involve huge datasets in which 
exhaustive sample-labeling requires expensive human resources and is 
often unrealistic. For example, in Bioinformatics or many Information 
Retrieval tasks, labeling data is a time consuming and a difficult task. 
For other problems such as remote sensing or medical imaging, labeling 
data may require very expensive tests so that only a small set of 
labeled data may be available. In some other domains, like targeted 
marketing, only a few positive samples are available while unlabeled 
examples are plentiful. In all these cases, we need to find ways of 
relieving the users of the annotation burden.

We will discuss recent developments, explore new issues and share ideas 
for future directions. We welcome papers that address any of the above 
questions or that focus on any of the following topics:

  * Learning applications, in Bioinformatics or Information Access 
areas, using both labeled and unlabeled data with techniques including:
    - Multi-modal semi-supervised methods: co-training or co-boosting,
    - EM like semi-supervised techniques,
    - Discriminative approaches,
    - Markov random fields,
    - Maximum Entropy with unlabeled data,
  * Diagnostic applications or theoretical issues to characterize the 
role and the importance of unlabeled samples for learning,
  * Techniques measuring the amount of information contained in 
error-prone samples relative to perfectly labeled observations,
  * Kernels for semi-supervised learning, i.e. how to create good 
kernels using both labeled and unlabeled data,
  * Tasks where unlabeled data may degrade the performance,
  * Query-based and active learning,
  * Learning with positive only labeled data,
  * Transductive inference,
  * Constrained clustering.

Are you running antispam or antivirus as root then?

It just occurred to me that maybe the files were created by some program that 
got confused by the character set in that signature

Whatever created the files must have been running as root

A while ago I purchased your great slideshow, which I am now using at my 
homepages.

Lately I realized one problem with it after a complain from one of the 
user's.

Let's say that I use images which long side is 1000 pixels. If user has 
a display with smaller resolution, example only 1024*768, slideshow will 
scale the images smaller.

The quality of this downscaling is very poor. Is there a parameter which 
would allow to choose the scaling algorithm, or do I just need to start 
using smaller images?

If I need to start using smaller images, I will loose one of the 
greatest functions of your slideshow, getting maximum viewing size no 
matter how small or big display user has.

Please let me know if there is anything what I can do to improve the 
scaling quality, in every other way the slideshow is just great!

Thank you for your assistance,

Best regards,

Janne Laaksonen

I'm happy to submit a patch, but I want to make sure it makes sense.
Can I get some guidance about the intended approach, please?

Hmm, would it? I mean, you can currently build extensions with MinGW (at least
from what I heard, I never managed to do so as it would require cross
compiling for Windows), so why would you say you'd have to update the header
files?

The web has quickly grown from a modest hypertext system of
interest to computer researchers to a ubiquitous information
system including virtually all of human knowledge.  Today's Web
provides ready access to not only text, images, and audio files,
but also to structured and semi-structured information, services
and people.  It offers an open, decentralized (and
uncontrollable!)  environment in which anyone can publish
information and services coupled with powerful search engines and
agents to find and rank results.  All of this is ubiquitously
available from wired, wireless and mobile devices.  Oh, and did
we mention that it's free?

The result is an environment enormously useful to people for
research, learning, commerce, socializing, communication and
entertainment.  We have just begun to explore how this vast
amount of machine accessible knowledge can be exploited and used
by machines -- to better serve human needs as well as to discover
new knowledge.

The special track on ""AI and the Web"" invites technical papers on
the use of AI techniques, systems and concepts involving the Web.
We are especially interested in receiving papers in two active
research areas: (i) using text and language analysis to interpret
and understand natural language text found on the web and (ii)
developing and exploiting ""Semantic Web"" languages and systems
that explicitly encode knowledge using languages such as RDF and
OWL.  Innovative papers in other areas describing research
involving both AI and the Web are definitely encouraged also.
The AAAI-06 track on AI and the Web welcomes submissions on all
topics relevant to the track, including:

SEMANTIC WEB
     Information integration
     New/better/different KR languages for the Semantic Web (e.g.,
     RuleML)
     Semantic Web grounded policy languages
     Semantic web and agents
     Semantic web in mobile and pervasive computing
     Semantic web ontologies
     Semantic web services
     Social aspects of web semantics
     Tags and folksonomies
     Proof, trust and provenance for web information
     Applications

NLP AND THE WEB
     Cross-language IR for the web
     Enhancing IR and web search
     Information extraction on the web
     Knowledge acquisition from the Web
     NLP for automating markup
     Machine translation for and using the Web
     Opinion extraction
     Question answering on the web
     Text summarization
     Applications

OTHER AI AND THE WEB RELATED TOPICS
     AI and web-based ecommerce
     AI for P2P and GRID environments
     Intelligent information retrieval
     Intelligent user interfaces for Web systems
     Multi-agent systems on the Web
     Ontologies for the Web (not semantic web related)
     Mining web logs, query logs, blogs
     Recognizing web spam (e.g., link farms, blog spam)
     Recommendation systems
     Social networking and community identification
     Trend spotting
     Link-analysis and graph mining on the Web
     Graph based methods for analyzing Web information
     Web personalization and user modeling

Prospective submitters unsure if their paper is relevant to this
track may send queries to aiweb06@cs.umbc.edu. Papers for this
special track should be prepared and submitted following the
general technical conference paper submission guidelines.
Submitted papers will be reviewed by qualified reviewers drawn
from a special track committee as well as the general program
committee, with the final selections determined by the track
co-chairs in conjunction with the AAAI-06 co-chairs.  Submissions
to this special track that are deemed not to be relevant may be
considered for review for the general technical papers track at
the discretion of the chairs.  Additional information including
the names of the program committee members is available at

This is about 4.3 just for the two DATE hits, although they don't
seem to hit anything else.

It's amazing to see 2-digit years at this late date.  But not unique.
The Educational Testing Service sends SAT scores to colleges from an
ancient mainframe system that uses 2-digit years.  We had to whitelist
them to make sure they get through.  (We have an ancient mainframe too
but it writes 4-digit years!)

A donation that reflects the real mix of email that you receive would be
fine. If it is easy for you to separate the mass mailing from your other
email, we would appreciate it if you uploaded them in separate chunks. 

This might make it easier for us to analyze results for different ""genres""
of email, should we decide to do this -- it is something we are considering.

>   2. The upload form has a size limit of 8MB.  

The file size limit for a single upload (typically a zip file) is 8MB.
There's currently also a limit of 100MB total server disk space per client
IP (includes the size of uploaded files and the total size of all extracted
emails). This 100MB limit is mainly to prevent abuse - we'd certainly like
to collect as much data as possible. If you have more than 100MB of data,
just let me know; You could also upload parts of it from computers with
different external IPs.

The data will be released for research purposes only. We don't have the
actual license text yet, but I imagine it will be similar to the TREC public
corpora license (see http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/treccorpus/).

Feedparser.org's chardet can't guess 'latin1', so it should be used as a
last resort, just as the docs say.

                       Paper Submission: September 30, 2006



Mobile autonomous robots can perform complex tasks in unstructured and 
dynamic environments. Advances in autonomous mobile robotics over the 
last decade have been extraordinary, and the potential for future 
scientific breakthroughs and applications is breathtaking. However, a 
number of bottlenecks to future advancement have been identified such as 
building robots that know what they are doing, and that can adapt to 
changing conditions and requirements.

This symposium seeks to move the research frontier forward by focusing 
on the scientific bottlenecks, namely equipping robots with more 
knowledge about internal representations and the external world, as well 
as developing an awareness of oneself and others.

Hosted by the University of Western Australia, and sponsored by 
Department of Education, Science and Technology (DEST, Australia) and 
National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, China), The 
University of Technology Sydney and University of Science and Technology 
China, the symposium has already won government support from both 
Australia and China and attracted an impressive list of leading 
researchers in Artificial Intelligence to serve on the program 
committee. The symposium aims at soliciting research ideas and results 
from practical research on implementing knowledge representation and 
high-level reasoning into mobile autonomous robots. Papers on autonomous 
agents and robots in general are all welcome, but the following areas 
are highly encouraged,

* Grounding representations to sensorimotor experiences
* Integrating knowledge representation into behaviour based robots
* Inter-robot communication and human-robot interaction
* Robot Cooperation and Collaboration
* Building Robots that Know what they are doing
* Networking multiple robots using Semantic Web or Agent Technologies
* Cognitive Robotics and their applications

Come and join the celebration of 50 years research in Artificial 
Intelligence at the world third most livable city - Perth (ranked in 
2005 http://www.cbcunlocked.com/artman/publish/printer_631.shtml). Come 
and experience the passion of mankind - trying to reverse engineer 
ourselves by building intelligence into software and hardware. Come and 
participate at very affordable registration to voice your research ideas...

CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS - DEADLINE EXTENDED
BOEMIE 2006 - Workshop on Ontology Evolution and Multimedia Information Extraction
http://www.boemie.org/boemie2006
October 6, 2006, Podebrady, Czech Republic
held as part of
EKAW 2006 - 15th International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management
http://ekaw.vse.cz/
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Due to several requests, the deadline for contributions to BOEMIE 2006 has been extended to August 10, 2006. A tentative list of speakers is given below.

MOTIVATION AND SCOPE
--------------------

BOEMIE 2006 focuses on the automation of the process of knowledge acquisition from multimedia content, using evolving multimedia ontologies which will be used for the extraction of information from multimedia content in networked sources. The goal is to develop synergistic approaches that combine multimedia extraction and ontology evolution in a bootstrapping process involving, on the one hand, the continuous extraction of semantic information from multimedia content in order to populate and enrich the ontologies and, on the other hand, the deployment of these ontologies to enhance the robustness of the extraction process.

The workshop is tightly coupled with the BOEMIE project, aimimg to initiate a new research activity on the automation of knowledge acquisition from multimedia content, through ontology evolution. The resulting technology will have a wide range of applications in commerce, tourism, e-science, etc. During the project, the technology will be evaluated through the development of an automatic content collection and annotation service for public events in a number of major European cities. The extracted semantic information will enrich a digital map, which will provide a friendly interface to the end user.

TOPICS
------

The workshop includes contributions to all research topics related to the BOEMIE project. We anticipate significant discussion owing to differences in potential approaches in handling the issues above. The detailed topics of the workshop include but are not limited to the following:

    * Knowledge driven multimedia analysis
    * Multimedia ontologies
    * Multimedia reasoning
    * Ontology learning
    * Ontology evolution
    * Combining multiple vocabularies
    * Interoperability among current multimedia and Semantic Web standards
    * Automatic and semi-automatic content annotation tools
    * Bridging the gap between multimedia features and semantics

GOALS
-----

The workshop is clearly related to the overall topic of EKAW, relating to knowledge engineering and Semantic Web technologies. Yet is it differentiating by focusing on the integration of two more distinct topics, ontology evolution and multimedia information extraction. Due to its multidisciplinary nature, we expect interesting discussions and exchange of different views from the involved participants and speakers. Specifically, BOEMIE 2006 is expected to:

    * bring together the different research communities involved
    * provide an overview of the state of the art in the field
    * provide a research agenda by listing open problems and promising directions
    * determine and prioritize potential work within future standardization organizations

WORKSHOP FORMAT
---------------

The workshop will mainly consist of a number of invited talks grouped in sessions according to its main research topics:

    * Introduction to the workshop and the BOEMIE project
    * Multimedia information extraction
    * Multimedia ontologies
    * Multimedia reasoning
    * Ontology learning and evolution

Each session will include a talk related to technologies developed in the BOEMIE project, as well as additional talks from people involved in related research projects and initiatives. A panel discussion will follow between the main invited speakers along with an open discussion with all participants.

Additionally, BOEMIE 2006 will feature a poster session with open contributions by anyone working on the research topics of the workshop. The session will foster the exchange of ideas, discussions, clustering or collaborations.

Registration to the main EKAW conference is required to attend the workshop.

There is an upper limit.  It's called ""the buffer size"".  If someone
specifies a buffer size of 16 bytes, it means ""read 16 bytes at a
time"".  I don't know why someone would want such a small buffer size,
but presumably they have their reasons.

The only reason ""min"" is a problem is that there's standard library
code passing a zero to socket.makefile, which gets turned into a
bufsize of 1 by the constructor.  I actually agree with Bill Janssen
-- __init__ is where the real problem lies.  But I think the change to
read() is safer.

Usama bin Laden(Osama bin Laden) one of the largest organizers of terrorist activity, and similarly the largest leaders of terrorist organization of Al Kaeda, detained American soldiery force in Iraq.

Ben Ladena consider participating to a number of diversionary acts: to encroaching upon the American citizens in Adene (Yemen) (1992), to the attack on the American servicemen in Somali (1993), to the explosion in the World shopping center in New York (1993), to murder of the American servicemen in Er-riyade and Dakhrane (Saudovskaya Arabia, 1995-1996), to shooting of tourists in Luksore (Egypt, 1997), to the explosions at the American embassies in Nayrobi (Kenya), Dar-es-salame (Tanzania) (1998), to encroaching upon the president of Uzbekistan of Islam of Karimova (1999), to injury of ship VMS of the USA in Yemen (2000), to the explosions of dwelling-houses in Moscou, Buynaksk and Volgodonsk, support of the Albanian separatists in Bosnia and Kosove and chechenskikh hits, in particular islams Khattaba, Abdully Maleka, Mukhammeda Sharifa and Salakh ÜÄ-Dinah. Ben is Well-built is an organizer of monstrous acts of terrorism in New York and Washington of September, 11 2001, taking away lives more than 5 thousand of persons after elimination by the airplanes taken the terrorists of two towers of the World shopping center.

""""""
The new timeout support in 2.6 makes use of new function
socket.create_connection().  socket.create_connection() provides no way
to disable timeouts, other than by relying on socket.getdefaulttimeout()
returning None.  This is unfortunate, because it was the purpose of the
new timeout support to allow control of timeouts without reliance on
global state.

setdefaultsocket.create_connection() should always call
sock.settimeout() with the timeout passed to create_connection(), unless
a special non-None value is passed indicating that the global default is
to be used.  Specific modules may then use that special non-None value
where required, to preserve backwards-compatibility.
""""""

Facundo doesn't seem to agree.  If I understand him correctly, he objects 
to the use of a special value other than None as an argument value.  I 
think avoiding this minor complication is secondary to avoiding 
gratuitously imposing global state on users where it's not needed.

Much existing code uses .setdefaulttimeout(), because legacy code does not 
expose the socket timeout.  Of course, not all of that code can be changed 
immediately (otherwise, why did we wait so long before Facundo did his 
valuable work on this?).  Of course, very often, code that calls 
socket.setdefaulttimeout(some_non_none_value) wants a default timeout for 
everything.  But that isn't *always* the case, and standard library 
modules that expose the timeout feature should not make that assumption. 
For example, an application might only want to set a timeout for some 
non-essential network operation.  As another example, useful but 
poorly-written library code might call .setdefaulttimeout().  Also, ISTM 
there's a big difference between nobody having contributed the time to 
implement the feature on the one hand, and deliberately imposing the 
global socket timeout state on users on the other!


Facundo indicates in the tracker discussion for 2451 that a decision was 
made here about this, but doesn't recall exactly which post, and directed 
me here.  What I found in the archive is this thread (sorry for the 
non-python.org URL):

http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/python/dev/555039?do=post_view_threaded#555039


In that discussion, this issue is raised, but I don't see any resolution 
that answers the objection made in issue 2451.  Anyway, apologies in 
advance if there was a decision here that takes account of the above 
objection.

I do want to thank Facundo for adding the timeout support to modules such 
as httplib.  But I also want to loudly complain about this detail :-)

I just built the trunk on a Windows XP x86 box that only has Visual C++
Express 2008 installed.  I got a bunch of errors with sqlite, tcl,
db-4.4.20, and ssl, but the interpreter built and appears to run ok.

But since I don't have bsddb installed, I don't think I'm executing the
portion of the build process that you find failing.

I don't have time to install bsddb tonight, but I can do that in about
24 hours if you still need me to.

Either don't scan mail from OWA or configure SA to trust your OWA box
(provided that the Exchange server doesn't directly accept any mail from
the outside world).

I would second the appreciation for a source RPM package.  It gives
those of us with touchy organizational methods a bit of a break.  :)

You managed to break the Universal Feed Parser.  Congratulations.  :-)

A (possibly partial) fix has been committed, but in order to exhibit 
these symptoms I suspect that there are more.  Continuing to investigate...

you are trying to hum the song).I figure that the maximum score for each
game must be 40.  That comes from three points for the song and three for
the artist from the short clip and one each if you need to go the longer
clip. Then ten points for the theme.

My results were
1	2 points (although I recognised the song from the short clip)
2	6 points (I actually gave myself three for Julie Covington because
strictly speaking Evita is not an artist)
3	4 points.  Got the artist from the first bar but couldn't remember
the song title for ages.  Had to use the pause button to get rid of the
distracting music)
4	0 points although I did recognise the tune I could not even begin to
place it.
5	6 points although the artist could have been one of many but it was
the one I wrote down.
6	10 points for the theme which became obvious after song two.

Total = 28

A good level of difficulty except for the theme which was a bit easy.

Subject: Merry Christmas!

Hi,

Merry Christmas!

Dad gets one present a day early this year (or on time, depending on  
how you look at it), because it's easier to give from here.  To keep  
things balanced, Mum gets one present a wee bit late (the delivery  
didn't quite make it on time)...

Each week (for the year, barring any major upheavals), you'll get an  
email with a small music quiz attachment.  The instructions are in the  
attachment, but basically you'll hear clips from five songs (one short  
clip and one longer one), and you have to name the song & the artist,  
and then the theme that links the five songs together.  The answers  
are at the end, so no cheating by fast-forwarding!

You'll have to email me back each week letting me know how well you  
did so I can make them harder/easier as necessary.

Hope all has gone well up there and the after-lunch nap was good :).   
We'l give you a call later on today.

Cheers,
Tony (& Liv & Sam)

I'll grant you that the bug is not new to 5.10.0.  However,
as reported in previous message, it can be made to core dump
in 5.10.0, and erroneously complains about unassociated
variables.  So the bug appears to have been exacerbated.

What do you mean by 'in this case probably normal'?
""Normal"" would denote proper or expected.  IMHO, it is
neither - it's a bug.

I think your file name may be too long for fat32. Spaces and brackets 
are also a frequent source of trouble when transferring file names.
If you need to keep this long name, you can pack the file within a 
tarball:
tar cvf shortname.tar  longname.pdf

But the best is to create a habit of storing names without brackets and 
spaces. Here is my alias for replacing all spaces in file names within 
the current directory:
alias cleanspaces='for i in *"" ""*; do mv -i ""$i"" ${i// /_}; done'
which I keep in my .alias

Depends. It's about latency multiplied by number of downloads vs. a
one time configuration step. People with extremely reliable and fast
internet connections certainly can afford your position.

  > And introducing this question

It seem you misunderstand the reason why it is there. The question is
not about parental control, it was introduced because there was demand
based on the fact that the software must give the user the right to
decide about connections to the internet *at least* once. When a user
specifies his own URLs, then this question is not needed anymore. But
before that there are plenty of reasons why a user does not want me to
connect anywhere.

I failed to understand that people do not understand this intent.
Sorry for that.

I got it now. I simply did not expect that any user would ever behave
like you do. Thanks for explaining it to me. I simply counted on
people to elect their neighborhood or intranet as the first choice for
downloading. So you have answered my question: apparently a config
variable will work for you.

It's now in my repository as rev. 2448. Hope this fits well.

It's time for a semi-monthly update from Twitter headquarters in 
sunny San Francisco, CA. There's lots of attention and activity 
surrounding Twitter these days and we're focused on staying ahead 
of pace. Don't miss a beat, come by and visit http://twitter.com 
to see what we're up to.

Bucking The System

Last weekend CNN lead with a big story about James Buck, a 
graduate student in journalism from the University of 
California-Berkeley who was arrested last month in Mahalla, Egypt 
while covering an anti-government protest. Thinking quickly, James 
was able to send a one-word Twitter update: ""Arrested."" His 
followers in Egypt and back in the US reacted by contacting the 
university and the consulate on his behalf. Before long, James was 
updating Twitter with another one-word message, ""Free.""

Twitter Japan

While we're on the subject of international adventures, it should 
be noted that Twitter has officially launched in Japan. We noticed 
a significant percent of Twitter usage consistently originating 
from Japan despite the fact that our service is in English. This 
highlighted an opportunity for us to make Twitter better so we 
worked with our partner in Japan, Digital Garage to launch a 
Japanese version of Twitter.

Mother's Day: On The Way

We've noticed a trend of parents twittering the moments of their 
baby's birth so we know there are some new moms on Twitter. Are 
you a mom on Twitter? Is your own mom on Twitter? Maybe you even 
made ""The Ultimate List of Moms on Twitter""? Mother's Day is just 
around the corner so don't forget to @reply the moms you know with 
a thoughtful phrase--but keep it under 140 characters, moms are 
busy people.

Ridiculously Awesome Greeting Cards

You'll be surprised at how funny a short, gutsy phrase can be when 
it's paired with an odd, old-timey illustration. You've got to 
check out this hilarious greeting card site that had us cracking 
up at the office recently. Maybe you'll find something for 
Mother's Day but while you're there, keep an eye out for the 
Twitter-inspired cards these talented writers have created. We 
hope they'll do more!

screenwriter of ""Juno"" and Hodgman is the guy who plays ""PC"" in 
those Apple ads on TV. Hodgman is also the Resident Expert on ""The

There are zero problems with the 3G devices offered by all providers 
currently (PCMCIA and USB dongle). They turn up as a /dev/ttyUSB0 and 
you just use ppp and your favourite dialer (pppconfig, wvdial, network 
manager) to dial the connection.

Now, be aware, 3G is not broadband. The advertised speeds of 3.6 Mbit/s 
is the total bandwidth in the cell. Good in less populated cells, 
terrible in busy cells like around Dublin. Some of the operatiors (O2) 
are actively firewalling any kind of VoIP, others like Three are 
competely overselling their network and artificially shaping the 
upstream to 60 kbit/s. As for Three, you might want to check 
3broadband.info first. They seem to have to degraded to a worse monster 
than Clearwire or BT's billing department :)

It is nowhere near broadband, merely a mobile internet access service 
with kind of acceptable download speeds.

Kind regards,
Martin List-Petersen

Could you please help me? This problem occures just for one Internet provider (Orange Poland) and not always, only sometimes. I have no more ideas what else can I check. I've placed TCP dump here: http://jakub.nadolny.info/tmp/tcpdump-cut.txt Thanks in advance, Jakub --- My previous e-mail: I've got following problem. Sometimes mail attachments are truncated and and e-mail is send but files are corrupted. Mail header contains then: ""X-Amavis-Alert: BAD HEADER MIME error: error: part did not end with expected boundary"". And that is true - there is no boundary for MIME and data stream is not completed. I've turned on detailed postfix debugging and it looks like at some point there is:  smtp_get: EOF instead of:  < some_IP: QUIT  > some_IP: 221 2.0.0 Bye Attachment is truncated after different sizes (sometimes 65kB, sometimes 200kB) and after different times (25s, 100s). The only common thing I've found is that all such mails come from one internet provider that is public-gprs*.centertel.pl I guess it might be the problem with this provider (Orange Poland) but on the other hand they can send e-mails through other mail servers without such a problem. I got stuck with it. Is there any way to debug it more? Do you have any ideas what could be the cause? I use postfix 2.3.8 on Debian Stable + amavis + other filters.",0,1

The only way I have ever gotten the nvidia drivers to not hang (using swsusp, tuxonice, uswsusp, whatever) is to use suspend-to-ram after disabling whatever magic video card hackery the distro tries (on the theory that the nvidia binary driver knows more about the quirks my card has than the sleep scripts the distro uses). > Michael > > > _______________________________________________ > TuxOnIce-users mailing list > enpsfhxz-stvnz@lists.tuxonice.net > http://lists.tuxonice.net/mailman/listinfo/tuxonice-users > ------------------------------ >From nlnpr@nigel.suspend2.net  Sun Feb 24 10:27:37 2008 Message: 5 Date: Fri, 08 Feb 2008 08:10:19 +1100 From: Nigel Cunningham  Subject: Re: [TuxOnIce-users] [TuxOnIce-devel] 3.0-rc5 released.

Alternatively, you can just set the  default console level higher than 1, or change it while hibernation is  running. This assumes that you have PM_DEBUG enabled.

[Apologies for cross postings]

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE ICAPS'07 DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM


The International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling
(ICAPS'07) invites PhD students to apply for the Doctoral
Consortium. The aims of the Doctoral Consortium are to provide a forum
for students to present their current research and receive feedback
from other students and senior researchers; and to facilitate
networking among Ph.D. students and senior researchers working in the
same area.

The Doctoral Consortium will provide a variety of opportunities for
PhD students to mutually discuss their work, and to meet senior
researchers with similar interests. Depending on the number of
submissions, it is expected that around 30 students are
accepted. There will be a full day workshop on September 22, where all
accepted papers will be given a short time slot for oral
presentation. Further, all accepted papers will be presented in a
poster session during the main conference. Two of the papers will be
distinguished with a best paper award, and a best paper runner-up
award, respectively. Each student will be assigned a mentor, i.e., a
senior researcher in the relevant area who will meet with the student
during the conference. Last but not least, students accepted in the
Doctoral Consortium will receive a scholarship that covers conference
registration and part of their travel expenses.

We encourage submissions from Ph.D. students at any stage and from any
topic area within Planning and Scheduling.  Preference will be given
to students who are far enough along to have formulated their
dissertation topic.  Applicants should submit an extended abstract of
three (3) pages maximum by email to the Doctoral Consortium chair.
The submission should be in AAAI style format and sent by email to the
Doctoral Consortium chairs, either as a PostScript or as a PDF file.
It should describe original work that is part of the doctoral work of
the student. We encourage the submission of work that is still in
progress. If an extended version of the paper is accepted at the main
conference or also submitted to a workshop, please indicate this in
the submission.  In addition, the dissertation advisor should send a
letter of recommendation by e-mail (plain text is sufficient) to the
Doctoral Consortium chairs.  It should indicate when the student is
expected to complete his/her dissertation and explain how the student
would benefit from participation in the Doctoral Consortium.


UPCOMING DEADLINES:

Submission deadline: 22nd June 2007
Notification date: 18th July 2007
Final versions due: 31st July 2007


Doctoral Consortium Chairs:

Joerg Hoffmann, University of Innsbruck, Austria, sflii.cpxufltt@deri.org

Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven <kyfxfuc@in-nomine.org>,zvllln-eum@python.org,"Thu, 07 Aug 2008 15:52:02 +0200",[Python-Dev] weird configure (autotools) setup,"Why is CFLAGS in Makefile.pre.in specified as
CFLAGS=         $(BASECFLAGS) $(OPT) $(EXTRA_CFLAGS)
whereas that will negate any CFLAGS you pass to configure?

A normal call to configure (as ./configure --help also explains) can contain
a CFLAGS specification, e.g.:

CFLAGS=""-compiler_options"" ./configure --config_options

Configure happily compiles and tests everything with the working CFLAGS (as
evident in config.log), but when it comes to the output substitution it
will, of course, not be overridden.

Now, I realize that configure.in talks about BASECFLAGS and OPT, but neither
of these are documented in the ./configure --help output, nor are they
standard when it comes to autotooling. Passing CFLAGS is the defacto
standard.

Furthermore, when passing compiler options to OPT, these are NOT taken along
in the configure tests, which means you might have passed faulty options but
configure will not detect any problems with them. You will only encounter
this when you start building.

So is there any rationale for all this?

All servers receive mail for ervv@example.com, but they need to
know where each user's mailbox is, so the idea is to use aliases
that map ervv@example.com to user@servername.example.com.  This
aliasing happens without changing the addresses from/to/cc/etc.
message headers.

Once the alias is expanded, the mail is either delivered on the
server itself (servername.example.com is its own name) or forwarded
to the machine servername.example.com.

For consistency these aliases need to be shared among all the
servers that accept mail for user@example.com. Something like LDAP
or SQL would do the job.

The above works because the delivery is controlled by the envelope
sender address, not by information in the message header.

How easy would it be to change the warning to 'use of uninitialized
value in XS code' under the appropriate circumstances? It would then not
give the impression that it is the call itself that is being warned
about.

Hello Wietse,

$ ls -ld /

$ ls -ld /home/cc
drwxr-xr-t  19 cc  cc  2048 24 Feb 00:35 /home/cc
$ ls -ld /home/cc/.maildir

drwx------  2 cc  cc  1536 24 Feb 00:35 /home/cc/mail/spool/new

The above looked OK to me, but I did chmod ugo+rx on all referenced
directories anyway and mail delivers correctly now! I have a vague feeling
that this isn't the first time I've done this...

Thanks for the help.

Windows XP, Drdos, Suse 10.2 and Suse 10.3 and its Failsafe choice.
When I choose Suse 10.2 I should get the original menulist from 10.2 with 
similar choices.
Up to an update (cannot remember when that was) everything worked as expected. 
Now if I choose Opensuse10.2 I end up without this 10.2 menu and what makes it 
worse, on Drdos. I have checked the menulist from 10.3 which looks okay.
For 10.2  it shows: 

 (root (hd0,6)) 
configfile /boot/grub/menu.lst

The last sentence is repeated 6 times (?) but reducing it to one time does not 
improve the booting.
I have checked the 10.2 partition and the menulist is there with the usual 
input.   
How can I get my 10.2 back?
Whether a faulty partition information has anything to do with this problem, I 
do not know.
All my partitions except swap are mentioned as Linux native (0x83 Linux) and 
Yast partitioner is not able or willing to change these partitions into FAT32 
and NTFS. If I know where this info is kept I would change it with an editor.

This probably needs to be refined a little.  Exclusive right is too 
strong, and it goes against Paul Moore's desire for using a single 
tool.  Perhaps instead what it should be is an ""uninstall warning"" 
field that must be displayed to a user if an interactive program is 
doing uninstallation, and that a non-interactive program must refuse 
to uninstall unless explicitly requested to go ahead.

Unfortunately, a warning message might then need to be localized.  So 
this idea still needs some work.

The physical RAM subsystem (on the mainboard) doesn't know what memory 
contains ""real"" data what is ""empty"" and has no way of being told this 
disctinction. It refreshes all the cells periodically.

Thus, this is not something which gives any advantage to one OS over 
another. Not, at least, for server, desktop or laptop systems. Perhaps 
some highly power-critical hardware such as portable audio players and 
cell phone have this ability, I don't know.

Lastly, it seems that were the sort of selective RAM refresh you suggest 
then Linux would be at a power _disadvantage_ since it tries to keep as 
much of the RAM as possible filled with (potentially) useful data while 
Windows seems to try to free it up when possible.

    as the day for PUGs to meet up in person, with Sunday geared more
    towards an online collaboration day via IRC, where we can take care
    of all the little things that got in our way of coding on Saturday
    (like finalising/preparing/reviewing patches, updating tracker and
    documentation, writing tests ;-).

    For User Groups that are planning on meeting up to collaborate,
    please reply to this thread on zvllln-eum@python.org and let every-
    one know your intentions!

    As is commonly the case, #python-dev on irc.freenode.net will be
    the place to be over the course of each sprint weekend; a large
    proportion of Python developers with commit access will be present,
    increasing the amount of eyes available to review and apply patches.

    For those that have an idea on areas they'd like to sprint on and
    want to look for other developers to rope in (or just to communicate
    plans in advance), please also feel free to jump on this thread via
    python-dev@ and indicate your intentions.

    For those that haven't the foggiest on what to work on, but would
    like to contribute, the bugs tracker at http://bugs.python.org is
    the best place to start.  Register an account and start searching
    for issues that you'd be able to lend a hand with.

    All contributors that submit code patches or documentation updates
    will typically get listed in Misc/ACKS.txt; come September when the
    final release of 2.6 and 3.0 come about, you'll be able to point at
    the tarball or .msi and exclaim loudly ``I helped build that!'',
    and actually back it up with hard evidence ;-)

    Bring on the pizza and Red Bull!

        Trent.

try:

shows :
- a traceback, as if I didn't put LookupAccountName in a try/except 
statement
- the string 'error' so the program has also switched to except as if 
the try/except has been correctly interpreted

So we can say that I get the two behaviours in one. At the exception 
that the traceback is not complete, it only talks about the line 
containing LookupAccountName, not entire traceback (the caller function 
and its parents).

IDAMAP 2005: INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS IN MEDICINE AND PHARMACOLOGY

Sunday, July 24, 2005

A one-day workshop during the 10th European Conference on Artificial 
Intelligence in Medicine 2005 (AIME 05) in Aberdeen, Scotland, UK
           
John Holmes and Niels Peek (chairs)

                   
Organized in collaboration with Intelligent Data Analysis and Data
Mining Workgroup of International Medical Informatics Association, and
Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining SIG of American Medical Informatics
Association

http://idamap.org/idamap2005

Submission:   April 24, 2005
Notification: May 23, 2005
Camera-ready: June 17, 2005


GENERAL INFORMATION

IDAMAP-2005, a one day Workshop on intelligent data analysis in
medicine and pharmacology, will be held at King's College Conference 
Centre in Aberdeen, Scotland, UK, during the AIME 2005 Conference.
This is the tenth IDAMAP Workshop: the former ones were held in Budapest 
in 1996, Nagoya in 1997, Brighton in 1998, Washington DC in 1999, Berlin 
in 2000, London in 2001, Lyon in 2002, Cyprus in 2003, and Stanford in 2004.

The IDAMAP workshop series is devoted to computational methods for
data analysis in medicine, biology and pharmacology that present
results of analysis in the form communicable to domain experts and
that somehow exploit expert knowledge of the problem domain. Such
knowledge may be available at different stages of the data-analysis
and model-building process. Typical methods include data mining,
temporal abstraction, machine learning, and data visualization.

Gathering in an informal setting, workshop participants will have
the opportunity to meet and discuss selected technical topics in
an atmosphere which fosters the active exchange of ideas among
researchers and practitioners. The workshop is intended to be a
genuinely interactive event and not a mini-conference, thus ample
time will be allotted for general discussion.


TOPIC

In the workshop the attention will be given to methodological issues of
intelligent data analysis and on specific applications in medicine,
biomedicine and pharmacology. In terms of methodology, topics include,
but are not limited to,

- data mining techniques, including machine learning, clustering,
  neural networks, etc.,
- other techniques for construction of predictive models,
- data visualization,
- analysis of large data sets,
- relational data mining,
- interpretation of time-ordered data (derivation and revision of
  temporal trends and other forms of temporal data abstraction),
- knowledge representation,
- knowledge management and its integration with intelligent data
  analysis techniques,
- utility of background knowledge in data analysis,
- integration of intelligent data analysis techniques within
  biomedical information systems.

A paper submitted to the workshop is expected to show a selected
methodology can help to solve relevant problems in medicine, and would
typically address the following issues:

- What is the medical or clinical problem addressed?
- Which knowledge representation was used?
- Was any prior knowledge available? How was this used in the
  data analysis or interpretation of results?
- How is/can the newly discovered knowledge put into use?

Contributions that discuss particular applications of intelligent data
analysis techniques are invited, and can for example cover analysis of
medical and health-care data, data coming from clinical bioinformatics
data bases (like microarray data and DNA sequence analysis), analysis
of pharmacological data, drug design, drug testing, and outcomes
analysis.

We also invite papers on data analysis tools. Such papers can overview
a particular tool and describe why and how this could be suitable for
intelligent data analysis in medicine and other application areas that
are a subject of the IDAMAP workshop. Preferably, the papers on data
analysis tools would also describe a case study where the tool was
used.


SCIENTIFIC PROGRAM

The scientific program of the workshop will consist of presentations
of invited and accepted papers and panel discussion. 


SUBMISSION & PUBLICATION OF ACCEPTED PAPERS

IDAMAP invites submissions of either short papers (2 pages, up to 1500
words, leading to a poster/short presentation at the meeting) or full
papers (up to 6 pages/4500 words, leading to a panel presentation at
the meeting). Papers should be written in English. Authors should send
an electronic submission in PDF format to both chairs
(eovykps@cceb.med.upenn.edu, o.p.fath@amc.uva.nl); please use
""IDAMAP SUBMISSION YOUR_NAME"" as a subject, where YOUR_NAME
is the surname of the first author. Alternatively to preferred PDF,
submissions using Post Script or MS Word format are also welcome.

The submissions should be received no later than April 24,
2005. Additional formatting instructions and instructions for authors
are available on Workshop's home page at http://idamap.org/idamap2005.

Authors will be notified of acceptance by May 23, 2005. Papers will
appear in workshop notes that will be distributed to registered
participants. A subsequent publication of selected and revised papers
in peer-reviewed journal is planned.


REGISTRATION

Participants of the workshop are not obliged to register for the AIME
conference. However, non-AIME participants will be charged a higher fee
than AIME-participants. Details on payment and registration will be 
announced later this spring and will be posted on the workshop's web 
page, (http://idamap.org/idamap2005) and the AIME 05 website 
(http://www.csd.abdn.ac.uk/aime05/).

I hate to bring it up, and I’m not particularly fond of dumping
on Perl 6, but compare how that effort is going with the Python
3000 track record, which took the “internal refactoring and
juggling (and it’s OK to break backcompat)” approach vs. the
“complete retink” approach of Perl 6.

I dunno.

If Gerard has the energy to pursue kurila on his own, I say he
should.

I also agree that p5p is probably not the place to discuss it –
not forever, anyway. However, I think for the time being it might
be better to keep that discussion here; I was recently reading a
bunch of Linus Torvalds lkml posts about Con Kolivas’ patches,
and somewhere he makes the point that special-interest mailing
list like the -ck patchset ML are problematic because they become
an echo chamber with no cross-polination of ideas and viewpoints.
That rings completely true.

I bought a 1GB module a couple of weeks ago, (Kingston DDR ECC 2.5CL 
400MHz), and it was EUR 60. Faster, (or larger) modules would have 
been closer to EUR 100.

Windows and Mac OS X have dedicated directories for application specific
libraries. That is ~/Library on Mac and Application Data on Windows. The
latter is i18n-ed and called ""Anwendungsdaten"" in German. Fortunately
Windows sets an environment var to the application data directory.

Junior Fellows at the Library of Congress [ http://www.loc.gov/extranet/paodocs/2008jrfellows/pnp-wide.jpg ]Today is one of my favorite days of the year, because it is one of the most compelling versions of ""show and tell"" anyone will ever get to see!

Every year for the past few years, thanks to the generosity of the late Mrs. Jefferson Patterson and the James Madison Council, the Library of Congress's private-sector advisory group, as many as 50 interns have come to the Library through the Junior Fellows program [ http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2008/08-113.html ].

They spend several weeks during the summer combing through both uncataloged copyright deposits and collections acquired through gifts, looking for ""hidden"" gems. And every year they do not fail to impress.

Past finds have included a 1900 blueprint for a proposed expansion of the White House; a 1906 photograph of baseball great Cy Young; a typescript of Cole Porter's 1916 debut Broadway musical, ""See America First""; a 1954 home movie of Marilyn Monroe; and an orchestral score by Jerry Goldsmith for the 1968 film ""Planet of the Apes.""

This year, 200 items were showcased, including Copies of the Virginia and New Jersey Plans (1787) upon which the current bicameral U.S. political system is based; a map of the proposed U.S. Capitol grounds by F.C. De Krafft (1822); selected items from the Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. Collection (1841-1935); the April 21, 1865, issue of the Weekly National Republican, which details Abraham Lincoln's assassination and its aftermath; a rare first-edition piece of instrumental sheet music for the ""Maple Leaf Rag"" by Scott Joplin (1899); a rare print of ""The Rajah's Casket"" (1906) by Pathe Freres, one of the first companies to experiment with the use of hand-coloring in motion pictures; and items pertaining to the 1929 film ""Applause,"" directed by Rouben Mamoulian, along with personal snapshots of the director on holiday with Greta Garbo.

Check out some highlights after the jump.

A clip from a video at the beginning of the display. This Google Earth tour showed the home cities of all of the Junior Fellows, along with some personal information about each. The full tour can be found via Google Earth, here  [ http://www.loc.gov/extranet/paodocs/2008jrfellows/2008-Library-of-Congress-Junior-Fellow-Tour.kml ](link opens in Google Earth).

Junior Fellows found the original copyright renewal application for ""Kinderscenen,"" reputedly the first song written by George Gershwin in 1913 at age 15. The ragtime was adapted from Robert Schumann's ""Traeumerei,"" or ""Reverie.""

And finally, a brief video clip.

During the silent era, earlier films by popular artists were edited together to create new releases. ""The Rounders"" (1914), starring Charlie Chaplin (1889-1977) and Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle (1887-1933), and another unidentified Chaplin film were re-cut, given new title cards, and combined to create ""Greenwich Village."" (""Greenwich Village,"" ca. 1922. 35mm black-and-white safety print from original film. AFI/Roach Collection, Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division, Library of Congress)

The other thing is that these tests are not reporting any warnings or 
errors if Carp/Heavy.pm is actually loaded.

It looks like for some reason it is loading Carp/Heavy.pm or some other 
module just in case it may be needed, possibly as part of an optimization.

I put debug print statements all through the Find.pm code where it was 
tripping the above warning, and it never took a code path that printed 
that the status of the chdir() succeeded or failed.

It would be easier to use substr():

   In 2.5.2 it prints




   Why the change? Is it a bug or a feature? Shouldn't .to_eng_string()
always return a str?

However, both counter examples are bad because they are true of most of 
the population, in addition to the target segment.  That's no 
correlation at all.

Narrow traits shared by narrow target segment and not the rest of the 
population are more of a correlation than not.  Correlation just gives 
you a starting point for exploration of a scientific study.  Dismissing 
a correlation as invalid is premature, unless you have counter evidence.

So, all you have to do, Jeff, is:
If the hypothesis is that owning an F-150 causes jackass driving:
Find random people with no history of jackass driving and give them a 
random assortment of F-150s and non-F-150s, and then measure how many 
become jackass drivers.

Or, oppositely, if the hypothesis is that jackass drivers are drawn to 
F-150s:
You need to find all jackass drivers before they buy their first car and 
find out how many of them choose to buy F-150s.

Or come up with a different hypothesis:
On a recent trip, a rental car type that I had never driven before 
greatly amplified my jackass-drivered-ness.  Either that or I had sleep 
problems or something, because I had a whole string of near accidents in 
the span of a few hours that I couldn't explain and were totally out of 
character.  I felt fine, but didn't perform that way.  I'm usually a 
fairly precision driver and spot things well before there's an issue.  I 
have a pilot's license for Pete's sake.  But in that car, on that day, I 
couldn't pull out of a parking spot without an issue.

Perhaps the F-150 has such poor ergonomics that it effectively lowers 
driver skill.

I am about to receive a machine built for me with a Raid 1 system
setup in Windows XP.  The drives are formatted 1/2 for NTFS, for Windows, 
and the other halves are unformatted.  I will either put on Suse 10.3, or wait 
for 11.0 to use the other halves of the drives.  (BTW:  if I d/l 10.3, will 
it have the bug-fixes already installed in the code, or not?)

How can I do this, retaining the Raid 1 configuration for Linux also?
And, how can I format the drives so that there will be a small FAT32
partition as well as the usual Linux partitions?  (ext3, I guess, altho Reiser 
has worked well for me.)  I don't remember that the install routine gives you 
the option of formatting different partitions with different file systems, or 
am I forgetting? What will Windows call the Fat32 partition?

For reference, I have both of the 9.2 books, but not 9.3, and I think, only
one 10.0 book.

Featured Artists







Dizzee Rascal
Dizzee Rascal, veteran of Roll Deep crew and winner of the prestigious Mercury Prize in 2003 for his ""Boy In Da Corner"" album has created what could easily be considered the definitive grime recording with ""Maths + English"" (also nominated for a 2007 Mercury Prize in the UK). Check out Sirens on the PMN and the video for Where's Da G's. 
 







Buckcherry
The song, Crazy Bitch was a strip club and radio staple for over a year, landing Buckcherry a platinum album and Grammy nomination with over 1.1 million albums sold. The follow-up single Sorry is currently blowing up, hitting the Top 10 – and it is now available on the Podsafe Music Network. Also check out the video here and catch them on the Motley Crue 2008 tour.

Featured Label






Ariel Publicity
Ariel Hyatt founded Ariel Publicity 10 years ago in Colorado and her company has since publicized thousands of dates for touring bands, hosted hundreds of special events, launched countless record release campaigns, and served as the PR director to several live music venues and festivals. She has gotten tons of artists onto the PMN, including Jamie Leonhart, Sugar Blue and Justin Hopkins to name a few. 
 








New on the PMN 







Mobile
Named by Alternative Press as one of the top 100 bands to look out for in 2008, Mobile is on the PMN with their '80s-affected rock-meets-new-wave sound. We really like the song Montreal Calling but check out all of their music and decide for yourself.

Punk Goes Crunk
One of the funnest records to come out in years! The follow up to Punk Goes Acoustic, Punk Goes Crunk features some of today's hottest young bands like New Found Glory, The Maine and more covering hip hop classics from OutKast, Snoop Dogg, Ol' Dirty Bastard and more. We have the entire thing  up now on the PMN for your listening and podcasting pleasure. Check out Lorene Drive's rocking version of Hey Ya!








Bryan Scary
 Bryan Scary & The Shredding Tears, the Brooklyn-based quintet, leaves no stone unturned, mixing elements of psychedelia, classic rock, indie, and prog into their sonic stew. Combining classic pop melodies, inventive chord structures, elaborate vocal harmonies, dazzling musicianship, and a quirky lyrical concoction of clever wordplay and outlandish third-person narratives, Bryan Scary & The Shredding Tears are poised to claim their own spot in    pop music's rich lineage.

RIYL: The Kinks, Queen, ELO, Frank Zappa, The Flaming Lips, Of Montreal










The Ike Reilly Assassination

Millencolin
 With an impressive string of releases behind them (nearly two million records sold worldwide) and having shared stages with the likes of Blink 182, the Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age, the Swedish  Millencolin show that they are on top of their game.

PETER BUFFETT DONATES SONG TO V-DAY 




 
 
 
ANTI-VIOLENCE SONG PERFORMED AT “V TO THE TENTH” CELEBRATION IN NEW ORLEANS ON SAT, APRIL 12 
“Peter Buffett’s song, ‘Can We Love?’ is a call to men everywhere to honor women and 
												        to end the violence against us. It is a call to honor what is tender in men, what is 
											          vulnerable and true.” ––V-Day Founder/Playwright Eve Ensler 
About V-Day: V-Day is a global movement to end violence against women and girls that 
												        raises funds and awareness through benefit productions of Playwright/Founder Eve 
												        Ensler’s award winning play The Vagina Monologues. In 2008, more than 3700 V-Day 
												        events will take place in the U.S. and around the world. To date, the V-Day movement 
												        has raised over $50 million and educated millions about the issue of violence against 
												        women and the efforts to end it. V-Day was named one of Worth magazine's “100 Best 
												        Charities” in 2001 and Marie Claire’s “Top Ten Charities” in 2006. The ‘V’ in V-Day 
												        stands for Victory, Valentine and Vagina.

#rpm -q   confirm the package installation, it does not do
anything

#rpm -e     removes the package. You can run the query
again to confirm that it was removed.

The files are dated 2 February. I was dealing with efax-gtk at that time. 
I did run the program as root at least once. Can that be the source of 
the files? If so, I can delete them and forget about them.

               CALL FOR PAPERS: LEARNING WITH MULTIPLE VIEWS

Workshop at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2005)

              http://www-ai.cs.uni-dortmund.de/MULTIVIEW2005/

########################################################################


TOPIC AND GOALS OF THE WORKSHOP

Multi-view learning is a natural, yet non-standard new problem setting;
it describes the problem of learning from data where observations are
represented by multiple independent sets of features. A typical example
is learning to classify web pages by either the words on the page or the
words contained in anchor texts of links to the page.

   Multi-view learning methods have been studied by Yarowsky (1995) and
Blum and Mitchell (1998), who noticed that having multiple
representations of examples can improve classification performance when
in addition to labeled examples, many unlabeled examples are available.
A recent result by Abney (2002) suggests that there may be an
underlying principle which gives rise to a family of new methods: The
disagreement rate of two independent hypotheses upper-bounds the error
rate of either hypothesis.  By minimizing the disagreement rate on
unlabeled data, the error rate can be minimized.

   In the last 2-3 years, several new supervised and unsupervised methods
have been proposed which appear to utilize this consensus maximization
principle in one way or another. However, in many cases the contributors
are not to the full extend aware of the relationships between their
methods and a possible common underlying principle. The workshop aims at
bringing together researchers working on learning problems with multiply
represented instances and consensus maximizing methods; our goals are to
make the intrinsic structure of this field more clearly visible and to
bring this interesting area to the attention of additional researchers.


SUBMISSION

Participants should submit a 6 page paper in PDF format, following the
format guidelines of the main ICML conference. Papers must be submitted
until April 1st via the workshop website.

Possible Topics Include:
   - analysis of algorithms: co-training, co-EM, co-EMT ...
   - active and semi-supervised learning
   - multi-view clustering and classification
   - novel learning tasks (interpretability, constraints, ...)
   - independence of views: quantification and relevance
   - text, web, and other applications
   - hierarchical, partitioning, spatial, spectral clustering
   - theoretical analyses
   - relation to other fields of learning (e.g., boosting)
   - consensus maximization principle
   - generative and discriminative models

I think a warning would be nice. I've run into a number of places that  
are breaking due to the change. Including parts of the standard lib,  
in particular, unittest.TestSuite as used by nose [1].

There is already an open issue with patches for this in the issue  
tracker [2]. I've been running trunk with the patch installed and am  
able to get past the breakage due to the change. I don't believe the  
current patch is kicking out a warning however.

|
| Sure. On a new system, install normally, except create a separate
partition for /boot. Once installation is complete, edit /etc/fstab so
that the original /boot partition is mounted somewhere else, or not
mounted at all. Afterwards, reinstall first grub to the root partition's
/boot directory, then reinstall kernel or copy old /boot partition
kernel/initrd contents to new /boot. From then on, the only changes to
the original /boot are changes you make manually - no changes from
installers or
| kernel rpms - and no way for your Grub boot manager to get screwed up
except by you doing it yourself. The net result is little different from
installing some other boot manager on its own partition.
|
| For protection against having a windoz reinstallation mess up your
boot loader, make the original /boot a primary, set it active, and
install grub on it and not on the MBR. Grub will continue to work
without any fancy reinstallation just by resetting its partition active
after doz has done its dirty work, something you can do with any number
of simple tools, including doz's FDISK. Only 2 bits in the MBR sector
need changing to switch active partitions from doz's to grub's.

Could you give me an example of the sort of adaptations that might be
necessary, or the API changes that would be necessary to make a
drop-in replacement possible?

Are you just talking about things like removing the context argument
from __add__ and friends, or is it more serious than this?

2nd Call for Papers

The Third International Conference on Soft Methods in Probability and 
Statistics (SMPS 2006)

5-7 September 2006, University of Bristol, UK

www.enm.bris.ac.uk/SMPS


Over the last thirty years there has been a growing interest in extending 
the theory of probability and statistics to allow for more flexible 
modelling of uncertainty, ignorance and fuzziness. Most such extensions 
result in a ""softening"" of the classical theory, to allow for imprecision 
in probability judgements and to incorporate fuzzy constraints and events. 
Many approaches utilise concepts, tools and techniques developed in 
theories such as fuzzy set theory, possibility theory, imprecise 
probability theory and Dempster-Shafer theory.

The need for soft extensions of probability theory is becoming apparent in 
a wide range of applications areas. For example, in data analysis and data 
mining it is becoming increasingly clear that integrating fuzzy sets and 
probability can lead to more robust and interpretable models that better 
capture both the inherent uncertainty and fuzziness of the underlying data. 
Also, in science and engineering the need to analyse and model the true 
uncertainty associated with complex systems requires a more sophisticated 
representation of ignorance than that provided by uninformative Bayesian 
priors.

Soft Methods in Probability and Statistics (SMPS) 2006 will be hosted by 
the Artificial Intelligence Group, Department of Engineering Mathematics at 
the University of Bristol, UK. This is the third of a series of biennial 
conferences organized in 2002 by the Systems Research Institute from the 
Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw and in 2004 by the Department of 
Statistics and Operation Research at the University of Oviedo in Spain.

SMPS 2006 aims to provide a forum for researchers to present and discuss 
ideas, theories, and applications. The scope of conference is to bring 
together experts representing all existing and novel approaches to soft 
probability and statistics. In particular, we would welcome papers 
combining probability and statistics with fuzzy logic, applications of the 
Dempster-Shafer theory, possibility theory, generalized theories of 
uncertainty, generalized random elements, generalized probabilities and so 
on.


For further information see the conference web page www.enm.bris.ac.uk/SMPS 
or email ghmc-9880@bris.ac.uk

Odd but true: delete /usr/$LIB/libIndirectGL.so.1. $LIB is either lib
(on my system) or lib64? Then compiz will start. The mystery I have is
why this file (a link) keeps coming back after reboots. Some entity want
to keep remaking this link. This solves the issue above. I do not know
about the issue below. Maybe they follow after the error above?

Please ignore this rant:

I suspect it is a problem because I have some incorrect mixture of Xgl
and the nvidia driver. The descriptions I have seen thus far of the
interaction between the two leave me less than informed. Developers have
spent a zillion hours getting all this to work, but have dropped the
ball in describing the great thing they have done in language understood
by the great unwashed masses. Too many 2 or 3 letter abbreviations are
used that assume one spends time working with X graphics.

You will have heard previous complaints from ex-service personnel and their families that the Army is demoralised and the government's ""covenant"" of care has broken down. But not before from the current head of the Army. Our lead report will look at comments from General Sir Richard Dannatt that the covenant is out of ""kilter"", about the ""unsustainable"" current level of operations; the army being ""undermanned"" and increasing numbers of troops being ""disillusioned"" with service life.  Sir Winston Churchill, grandson of Britain's famous wartime leader will join us live.

Every child to read at six
===========================
 
And�

""All was quiet in the deep dark wood, 
The mouse found a nut and the nut was good.""
 
Mention The Gruffalo, and if you have young children, the chances are you could also quote chunks of the story's gentle rhyming couplets. The author, Julia Donaldson (who�s also written reading scheme books for schools) is on the show tonight to express her fears over the Tories' controversial plans to get children reading by the age of six and to make synthetic phonics compulsory. That's when you learn every letter's sound before you even start to put them together and read actual words and simple books. It's apparently incredibly hard to write interesting stories for young learners if you strictly follow synthetic phonics though. No irregular words like ""bought"", ""nice"" etc.
 
The shadow schools' secretary Michael Gove will be here live to explain why the Tories believe it's time to go back to the old method and make it compulsory. But they also want to test every six-year-olds' reading. By their own figures 10 percent of children will fail. With Labour's much praised ""literacy hour"" and other reading schemes supposedly boosting standards dramatically, we'll try to work out what's really new in the Conservatives' proposals, and, crucially, whether any party can crack the persistent underachievement among a high proportion of Britain's most deprived children.


Annual whale-hunt begins
========================
 
Japan's annual ""scientific research"" whale hunt has begun. While much of the meat ends up in children's school dinners, as part of a nationalist political campaign to support fisherman, this time (for the first time in 40 years) they're hunting humpbacks, too. Carl Dinnen has been looking at why and whether the environmental campaign against whale hunting has lost momentum.
 
Join me and Carl at 7.30 for a full half hour.
See you then.

AIMS

Several initiatives have been launched in the 
area of Computational Linguistics,
Language Resources and Knowledge Representation 
both at the national and international level 
aiming at the development of resources and
tools. Unfortunately, there are few initiatives that integrate these results
within eLearning. The situation is slightly better with respect to the results
achieved within Knowledge Representation since ontologies are being
developed which describe not only the content of the learning material but
crucially also its context and the structure. 
Furthermore, knowledge representation techniques 
and natural language processing play an important
role in improving the adaptivity of learning environments even though they
are not fully exploited yet.

On the other hand, eLearning environments constitute valuable scenarios
to demonstrate the maturity of computational linguistic methods as well
as of natural language technologies and tools. 
This kind of task-based evaluation
of resources, methods and tools is a crucial issue for the further
development of language and information technology.

The goal of this workshop is to discuss:
? the use of language and knowledge resources and tools in eLearning;
? requirements on natural language resources, standards, and applications
originating in eLearning activities and environments;
? the expected added value of natural language resources and technology
to learning environments and the learning process;
? strategies and methods for the task based evaluation of Natural Language
Processing applications.

The workshop will bring together computational linguists, language resources
developers, knowledge engineers, researchers involved in technology-enhanced
learning as well as developers of eLearning material, ePublishers and eLearning
practitioners. It will provide a forum for interaction among members of
dierent research communities, and a means for attendees to increase their
knowledge and understanding of the potential of computational resources in
eLearning.

TOPICS

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
*  ontology modelling in the eLearning domain;
* Natural Language Processing techniques for supplying metadata for
learning objects on a (semi)-automatic basis, e.g. for the automatic
extraction of key terms and their definitions;
* techniques for summarization of discussion threads and support of
discourse coherence in eLearning;
* improvements on (semantic, cross-lingual) search methods to in learning
environments;
* techniques of matching the semantic representation of learning objects
with the user?s knowledge in order to support personalized and adaptive
learning;
* adaptive information filtering and retrieval (content-based filtering and
retrieval, collaborative filtering)
* intelligent tutoring (curriculum sequencing, intelligent solution analysis,
problem solving support)
* intelligent collaborative learning (adaptive group formation and peer
help, adaptive collaboration)

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Submissions by young researchers are especially welcomed.

* Format. Authors are invited to submit full 
papers on original, unpublished work in the topic 
area of this workshop. Papers should be submitted 
as a PDF file, formatted according to the RANLP

I think the hack is indeed as described. It was not really messing up my
system. It used it as a stage to probe other systems. I got a visit from
our IT department that there was a complaint about this server from some
external site. I was not surprised. It seems that the password changes
have resolved the issue. At least for now. I will have to keep watch for
something else. But I do not think the system was compromised. In
summary, I would say a user let someone use his account to run some
unexpected software.

Hi all new to the forum.
Question I  recently tried to do an sa-update on a server that we collocate
which means I did not  install spam assassin. When I did the update I got
the following error below.
Could this mean that Spam Assassin was installed  incorrectly? and what can
I do to correct the problem. 

Thanks in advanced:

And I'll bet that this instability doesn't come immediately...
but after some fairly consistant amount of time after you
start the load...

Which would take us back to my earlier suspicion of HEAT

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ISIPTA meetings are one of the primary international forums to
present and discuss new results on the theory and applications of
imprecise probabilities. Imprecise probability has a wide scope, being
a generic term for the many mathematical or statistical models which
measure chance or uncertainty without sharp numerical
probabilities. These models include belief functions, Choquet
capacities, comparative probability orderings, convex sets of
probability measures, fuzzy measures, interval-valued probabilities,
possibility measures, plausibility measures, and upper and lower
expectations or previsions. Imprecise probability models are needed in
inference problems where the relevant information is scarce, vague or
conflicting, and in decision problems where preferences may also be
incomplete.

Themes of the symposium
-----------------------

Although the symposium will be open to contributions on all
aspects of imprecise probability, three main themes will be
emphasised: decision-making, algorithms, and real applications.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

models of coherent imprecise assessments
convex sets of probability measures (credal sets)
interval-valued probabilities
upper and lower expectations or previsions
non-additive set functions, and in particular Choquet
    capacities (and Choquet integration), fuzzy measures,
    possibility measures, belief and plausibility measures
random sets
rough sets
comparative probability orderings
qualitative reasoning about uncertainty
imprecision in utilities and expected utilities
limit laws for imprecise probabilities
physical models of imprecise probability
philosophical foundations for imprecise probabilities
psychological models for imprecision and indeterminacy
    in probability assessments
elicitation techniques for imprecise probabilities
robust statistics
probabilistic bounding analysis
data mining with imprecise probabilities/missing data
estimation and learning of imprecise probability models
decision making with imprecise probabilities
ambiguity aversion and economic models of imprecise probability
uncertainty in financial markets
algorithms for manipulating imprecise probabilities
Dempster-Shafer theory
information algebras and probabilistic argumentation systems
probabilistic logic, propositional and first-order
credal networks and other graphical models
credal classification
applications in statistics, economics, finance,
         management, engineering, computer science
         and artificial intelligence, psychology,
         philosophy and related fields

Workshop on Financial Risk Assessment
-------------------------------------
There will be a workshop addendum to the conference,
to be held on July 24, with invited speakers on the topic
of financial risk assessment, to which all of the ISIPTA'05
participants are welcome, at no additional registration cost.
Details will be announced later.

Location
--------
ISIPTA '05 will be held at Carnegie Mellon University,
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States.

Important dates
---------------
(Note that we have moved the deadlines, as we move dates
a bit with the publisher!!)
Paper submission deadline: February 25 2005
Notification of acceptance: April 15 2005
Deadline for revised papers: May 15 2005
Symposium: July 20-23 2005

Submissions and Proceedings
---------------------------
We will accept papers only as PDF files with a limit of 8 pages
in two-column format. Guidelines are available both in a PDF file
and in a word file at the site
    http://www.sipta.org/isipta05/submit.html.
The simplest way to produce an article that satisfies these
requirements is to use Latex with the isipta2005.sty style, using
guidelinesat the file isipta05.tex (or using this file as a
template). Otherwise, use the file isipta2005.doc as template.

Submission is electronic. You should introduce paper data and
attach the PDF file by using the submission page.

The Program Committee will decide which of the submitted papers
are accepted, by carefully evaluating their originality, significance,
technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. All the accepted
papers will be included in a volume of proceedings, published
by Brightdocs.

There will be free electronic access to the proceedings after some
time. Before the conference, the electronic access will be restricted
to the ISIPTA '05 attendees to allow them to study the papers in some
detail before they are actually presented. Each accepted paper will be
given the opportunity for both a brief oral presentation as well as
a poster session.

My bet would be CPANPLUS/t/inc/conf.pl:

     ### paths to our own 'lib' and 'inc' dirs
     ### include them, relative from t/
     my @paths   = map { ""$FindBin::Bin/$_"" } qw[../lib inc];

     ### absolute'ify the paths in @INC;
     my @rel2abs = map { File::Spec->rel2abs( $_ ) }
                     grep { not File::Spec->file_name_is_absolute 
( $_ ) } @INC;

     ### use require to make devel::cover happy
     require lib;
     for ( @paths, @rel2abs ) {
         my $l = 'lib';
         $l->import( $_ )
     }

Perhaps File::Spec strikes again?

Greetings AWS Developers,

No shortage of exciting news items this past month!  Customers of AWS Infrastructure Services are now benefiting from lower data transfer costs and AWS Premium Support services.  Amazon EC2 has announced the upcoming availability of persistent storage, and for those of you who are both merchants and developers, make sure you read about the Amazon Fulfillment Web Service to learn how you can integrate even more closely with the Fulfillment By Amazon program.

******************************************************************************
LOWER DATA TRANSFER COSTS FOR AWS INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES
******************************************************************************
We've often told you that one of our goals is to drive down costs continuously and to pass those savings on to you. We have been able to reduce our costs for data transfer, so we're pleased to lower our pricing for data transfer, effective May 1, 2008. We've reduced prices at every existing usage tier of transfer out, as well as added an additional tier for the heaviest users. Please see the full announcement for more details.

******************************************************************************
AWS PREMIUM SUPPORT NOW AVAILABLE
******************************************************************************
In mid-April, we were pleased to announce the availability of AWS Premium Support. Customers who sign up for AWS Premium Support will receive personalized technical assistance from the Amazon Web Services team, whenever and as frequently as their business demands. Customers can contact AWS developer support engineers and count on fast, predictable response times and personalized support for operational issues or technical questions associated with AWS Infrastructure Services. In addition to the launch of AWS Premium Support, we also announced a Service Health Dashboard, which reports the status of our services and is available free-of-charge to all AWS customers.

******************************************************************************
AMAZON EC2 UPCOMING FEATURE: PERSISTENT STORAGE
******************************************************************************
Last month, we announced a major upcoming feature that many of you have requested - persistent storage for Amazon EC2.  This new feature provides reliable, persistent storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances.  These volumes exist independently from any Amazon EC2 instances, and will behave like raw, unformatted hard drives or block devices, which may then be formatted and configured based on the needs of your application.  The volumes will be significantly more durable than the local disks within an Amazon EC2 instance.  Additionally, our persistent storage feature will enable you to automatically create snapshots of your volumes and back them up to Amazon S3 for even greater reliability.  We expect to make persistent storage for Amazon EC2  publicly available later this year.  To learn more about persistent storage and how to sign up for a spot in the private beta program, please see the full announcement.

We usually don't like to talk about other people talking about us, but we thought these two articles were pretty cool, so we're making a rare exception.  The article in Wired Magazine gives a great overview of cloud computing and web services as a key part of Amazon's business.  The BusinessWeek piece is an interview with Jeff Bezos that discusses innovation at Amazon.  Good reads!

Query volume = server load and bandwidth = increased costs for the URIBL 
operators. What's so hard to parse about that logic?

It's basically saying ""we're willing to give away up to x mbytes of 
bandwith and x cpu hours per day for free, beyond that, you need to pay 
for the service.

Well, AFAIK you're not a non-profit, you're a commercial ISP, so that 
point isn't directly relevant to your situation. Still, I don't see 
anywhere that says URIBL requires nonprofits to pay, or at least offer 
them steep discounts on data feeds (SpamHaus does the latter.). They 
don't exactly have their pricing on their website. AFAIK you've only 
seen their ""for profit mid sized ISP with heavy query load"" pricing.
> Or take Vernon's DCC project, he provides a value added

Well, not really true. DCC is free for those who contribute back to DCC. 
Your queries to DCC double as volume report data, which is what makes 
DCC work in the first place. So, here by using DCC you're directly 
giving back. DCC is *NOT* free if you try to run a private server that 
doesn't report its statistics back to the public DCC network.

That doesn't really seem sensible to me. Who wants a ""special server"" 
for a high volume site? It's a waste of your own bandwidth as well as 
the RBLs.. You really want rsync at that point.

Perhaps they're just trying to cover their operating cost, as opposed to

Personally, I think you're jumping to conclusions for no good reason.

I have attached the flyers for the upcoming Active Movement opportunities

The Zoo Day is just  around the corner - next Thursday March 13th. Last year
was a day crammed full of fun, laughter and movement for our small children,
their families and friends.

Living in the Harbour region means that we are never too far away from water
so we have an upcoming workshop that focuses on building water confidence
for children under five. This workshop, Active Movement in Water, is being
held on March 26th and will be presented by Sharon Burger from Swimming New
Zealand.

Finally, I have attached some information for early childhood centres who
would like to know more about the new Food and Nutrition Guidelines for
Early Childhood Education Services and School Communities.

Please forward this information to anyone you think would benefit from it.

If you would like any additional information please feel free to contact me

Company name: iAnnounce

Location: United Kingdom

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We run the biggest online family announcement network in the UK, and we
need to expand our team.

There are a lot of interesting projects coming up (along with some dull
ones), so you will need to learn quickly, and be able to think for
yourself. Fast response is essential.

You would start with some of the smaller projects on a contract basis, with
the possibility of moving to full time employment if all works out.

We're looking for somebody who thinks about what they're doing - if you can
think of a better way, and can defend it, then we'll go with your way. Not
just a doer.

If you're on Perl Monks or CPAN, please send your nicks as well as your
real name.

You will need fluent English, your own development environment, almost
certainly Linux/*NIX based and a good internet connection for Skype calls.

Please also include your expected day rate in Euros.

We are UK based, but are very comfortable with tele-commuters.

Required skills:
 - Solid OO Perl experience (5 years +, but depends on experience)
 - Good web experience (the usual mod_perl, XHTML, CSS, JS)
 - XML
 - MySQL 
 - Linux

Desired skills:
Because there are a variety of projects, there are a variety of desired
skills - you are not expected to have all of these:
 - AJAX
 - VOIP
 - SMS gateways
 - Video on the web
 - Data analysis
 - Design
 - User flow analysis

That's normal - the first time it is loaded it simply connects to the
Service Control Manager and request the service be started.  The SCN then
causes the executable to be loaded as part of running the service.

Did you check the Windows event log?  Errors encountered by the service

Snowmail - Channel 4 News <bjhxttys_lhgwf@channel4.com>,undisclosed-recipients:;,"Thu, 07 Aug 2008 06:25:22 +0000",Cameron wants to limit non-EU immigration,"Greetings All - Alex Thomson here with a sneaky little look at what we are perpetrating on tonight's Channel 4 News for you...

Cameron wants to limit non-EU immigration
=========================================
First off, immigration. Mr Cameron has pleaded again for a grown-up debate on immigration and how to control the numbers - so we are trying to provide one for him since we're always trying to be obliging to our political leaders. It cannot go on like this, is basically Dave's lament. 
 
He wants to limit the numbers of non-EU immigrants to the UK. This, as we believe the Government is also about to announce restrictions and controls on some aspects of immigration. Dave isn't being very specific. He's not talking numbers or quotas as yet - but proposes an approach that will be coupled with improving basic skills amongst Britons, whilst recognising that immigration needs to be more restrictive.
 
Well as ever with this subject - that is his 'recognition' and many will disagree with that - just as many (like UKIP) will say the Tories still basically believe in an open-door policy and that must change radically. So much to debate there and if we can manage it without all the usual hysterics over 'playing the race card' etc etc then so much the better.
 
King Abdullah visits the UK
===========================
All the pageantry, carriages, red carpets and banqueting are being brought to bear as the Queen welcomes King Abdullah, the Saudi Head of State, for a visit to the UK. Many will wish to protest -- as they did when the Chinese leader rolled into London -- and for the same reasons: torture, lack of respect for human rights etc.

But money talks and human rights walk when it comes to the sandy place and its leaders. So it is that with billions of pounds in trade; 20,000 Brit ex-pats in the Kingdom and oil like nobody else on earth has it - successive British governments have felt the House of Saud must be talked to.
 
As befits the oil-soaked Kingdom -- their Royals fly into Heathrow this afternoon in five -- repeat five -- jets. Anyone willing to bet whether or not they've offset their flights?

Thought not.

Sarkozy walks out of interview
==============================
Anyhow - we've lots more for you tonight including a la flounce de la republique as Monsieur Sarkozy walks out of an interview in the fit of Presidential pique. You can watch our report here: http://tinyurl.com/2r8wlf The mother of a British soldier killed in Iraq holds Tony Blair personally responsible as the inquest opens; the latest on the Chad child orphans 'scandal'; a look at Argentina's new leader and how the continuing soaring global oil price is panning out across the world economies.
 
Plus - from Simon Sainsbury up to �100 million of paintings, courtesy of the grocer: Degas, Monet, Bacon, Freud and more. It's a simple deal: you buy the fruit and veg down the family shops, Si makes a vast stash. You get to see the doodles he's bought.

What goes around comes around: shrink-wrapped carrots into priceless masterpieces via the wonders of modern industrial retailing.
 
See you around seven if you're up for it - with all the above and more.
 
Alex T.



And on More4 News at eight:
 
We're busily perpetrating as well. Planning a discussion on the rights and wrongs of a right royal welcome for the Saudis; and broadcasting a film from Central Asia, the genesis of which involved a reporter who was murdered last week.  
 
The film is about Hizb Ut Tahrir in Kyrgyzstan. One of the people who helped set it up was a journalist called Alisher Saipov. As well as fixing for foreign news programmes, like ours, he ran his own paper, called Politics. An Uzbek-language paper, often critical of the government and its president. The paper is smuggled across the border into Uzbekistan. On Wednesday he was executed outside his office in Osh, Kyrgyzstan.  
 
We are in contact with his friends and supporters, both in London and abroad. The Kyrgyz president has said he will personally oversee the investigation into Alisher's death.  We'll be following developments closely and will broadcast what news we have, when we have it.

Today when I was setting up my project, I noticed that non-gmail
usernames for Google accounts are obfuscated with an ellipses. For
example, look at the ""Project Owners"" for http://code.google.com/p/pg-ipfw/

I'd like to turn the obfuscation off. I think this should be possible
given the fact that http://code.google.com/u/@UBNWQFdUDhhBXgR1/ and
http://code.google.com/u/snmnvlc@mg2.org/ are functionally equivalent,
but it may be that the option doesn't exist. I walked through the
preference pages and didn't see anything.

That said, if anyone knows the trick to doing this, I'd appreciate the
help.

You'd need a lot of crypto magic dust to make an open, decentralized  alternative offer the same benefits -- but such systems are inscrutable  to most people. No one's cracked the crypto comprehension/usability nut. But people can understand 'friend-of-friend' much better than  ""public/private key"". And having some profit-motivated entity with a zealous proprietary  interest in the quality of the graph is a feature, not a bug. So lots of  the kum-ba-ya ""let's open it all up"" talk is missing the point. SSNs are awful -- despicable! -- as the master key to peoples' credit  and identity.

That's a rather long thread. Was any conclusion reached? I'm not sure
how introducing a set of aliases will help merging 2.6 code to 3.0.
Can you or Christian describe the proposed approach in more detail?

Rich,

There is a paper by Peter Neumann, entitled ""Why don’t Americans use 
cost-effectiveness analysis"".
http://www.ajmc.com/files/articlefiles/AJMC04MayNeumann308_12.pdf
This is not what you are looking for, but I think it still may be of 
interest.

A book by the same author further explores those ideas: ""Using 
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis to Improve Health Care : Opportunities and 
Barriers"".

Best regards,
   Javier

This of course doesn't goes very well with the run-time method lookup. This isn't specific for autobox, but more about OO in general. Of course you can lookup push and flatten at compile time, but then I would like that to work for everything, requiring a whole redesign of calling methods, and I am not sure how to do that. --  Gerard Goossen TTY Internet Solutions",0,0

Subject: [R] How to calculate GLM least square means?

Hello R-helpers,

I would like to calculate least square means after having built a GLM with
quasipoisson errors.

In my model the dependent variable is continuous, I have one continuous
independent variable and one categorical independent variable (that is the
variable for which I would like to calculate the least square means).

I've looked around for the command to calculate the least square means, but
I can't find it.

Thanks for your help, Mark

I understand the two step reporting process too, and I too find it 
annoying and timeconsuming to ack my (manually reviewed) 50 spams per 
day to them, so I ceased to do it. There exist scripts for ack'ing 
automatically, but this is not the intention of this process, so this is 
no alternative for me.

Additionally, the loading time of the website to acknowledge the spam is 
very slow. And it is not optimized to ack with the minimum count of 
clicks and scrolling within the pages. At least this was the case when I 
first tried it a few months ago. Haven't checked back since.

This is the tenth workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics,
an interdisciplinary gathering of researchers at the intersection of
computer science, statistics, and related areas. Since its inception
in 1985, the primary goal of this workshop has been to broaden
research in both of these fields by promoting the exchange of ideas
between them. We encourage the submission of all papers which are in
keeping with this objective.

Presentations will include invited talks, contributed talks, and
posters. Papers for poster sessions will be treated equally 
with papers for presentation in the publication. 

Submission Requirements: 
------------------------- 
			  
Electronic submission of papers is required. The papers (up to 8 pages
in length) should be submitted through the AI and Statistics
Conference Management page. See: http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/aistats/submit.htm

Submissions will be considered if they are received by 11:59 PM
September 28, 2004, Pacific Daylight Time. Acceptance notices will be
emailed by November 3, 2004.

Final papers (up to 8 pages, double column) must be received by 
November 24, 2004. These papers will be made available on the web,
published in the proceedings, and distributed at the workshop in
electronic form.

We have a dinky little display step thing outside the front door but no pots
of plants on it so something like an outdoor pot or two (not too large, but
bigger than for a windowsill) would go well

She does like going out for lunch so if you wanted to give her a voucher for
when you were up and Olyvia and Sam could take her to lunch in Kamo
especially if it were the right day timetable wise.

She likes the little packets of crackers and cheese for her lunch at school
but we can't seem to find them in our supermarkets anymore.

It's ages since she had a new computer game but they do need to be of the
cards mah jong variety.

Always likes powder and that is the only smellie that anyone can get here
really.

Anything with Sam on it.

You could try putting together a Sam (and his parents) electronic scrap
book/video/whatever, a little like the one you made of Mangawhai.

That's about it for now unless you wanted to get her Red Dwarf V (oops,
that's for me)

You can't write nice repr's for arbitrary iterators, or things like  enumerate and friends that can operate on arbitrary iterator, because  you have no way to get at the 'first few' and 'the last' value. You can only have a nice representation like that for iterables like  range which have random access to the underlying values. Note that range  is NOT an iterator in Py3k as it has no __next__ method (the same hold  trues for xrange in 2.x). However, it would be really nice if collections.dict_keys,  collections.dict_items and collections.dict_values could provide a nice  repr implementation that was the rough equivalent of: def full_repr(self):    contents = ', '.join(map(repr, self))    return ""<%s: {%s}>"" % (self.__class__.__name__, contents)  >>> d = dict(a=1, b=2, c=3)  >>> d {'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2}  >>> full_repr(d.keys()) """"  >>> full_repr(d.values()) ''  >>> full_repr(d.items()) """" Cheers, Nick. --  Nick Coghlan   |   uytankmf@gmail.com   |   Brisbane, Australia ---------------------------------------------------------------              http://www.boredomandlaziness.org _______________________________________________ Python-Dev mailing list zvllln-eum@python.org http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev Unsubscribe: http://mail.python.org/mailman/options/python-dev/python-dev%40tangomu.com",0,1

Bazaar supports lightweight checkouts which act like svn checkouts.
They are also actively working on allowing for partial checkouts. That
way you can either specify an initial revision to pull the history
down to or start with an initial lightweight checkout and have it save
history as it pulls it over the network as you use it.

INFERRING RELEVANCE FROM EYE MOVEMENTS CHALLENGE 2005


The Challenge is to predict from eye movement data whether a reader
finds a text relevant.

The scientific goals are:

 * To advance machine learning methodology
 * To find the best eye movement features
 * To learn of the psychology underlying eye movements in search tasks

The results will be presented in a workshop. We will do our best to
arrange it in connection with a major conference. Authors of the best
presentations will be invited to extend their talks into articles in a
special issue of a journal.


The Challenge is at

[0]I Don't Believe in Imaginary Property writes ""We all know that false
or misleading science headlines are all too common these days and that
misleading media combined with an apathetic and undereducated public lead
to widespread ignorance. But the real question is, how can this trend be
reversed? At a session at the recent AAAS meeting, a study was discussed
indicating that [1]what matters most is how the information is portrayed.
While people are willing to defer to experts on matters of low concern,
for things that affect them directly, such as breast cancer or childhood
diseases, expertise only counts for as much as giving off a 'sense of
honesty and openness,' and that it matters far less than creating a sense
of empathy in deciding who people will listen to. In other words, it's
not enough to merely report on it as an expert. You need to make sure
your report exudes a sense of honesty, openness, empathy, and maybe even
a hint of humor.""

The FCC held its [0]hearing on network neutrality and Comcast today at
Harvard. One commentator not afraid to predict what will come of it is
O'Reilly's [1]Andy Orem, who writes: ""The mere announcement of an FCC
hearing on 'broadband network management practices' was a notch in the
gun of network neutrality advocates. Yet to a large extent, the panelists
and speakers were like petitioners who are denied access to the king and
can only bring their complaints to the gardeners who decorate the paths
outside his gate. [2]What we'll end up getting is a formal endorsement of
non-discrimination as a policy that Internet providers must follow,
leading to continual FCC review of current practices by telecom and cable
companies.""

Wired's editor-in-chief Chris Anderson is working on a new book, to be
published next year, about the idea of ""free"" in the old and new
economies. Wired is running a [0]long excerpt from the book and some
sidebars about the economics of giving away, e.g., [1]CDs and
[2]directory assistance. Techdirt has [3]a few quibbles about Anderson's
ideas ��� mostly areas in which he may be shading the argument to sell more

[0]Googling Yourself writes ""Google announced that they will be part of a
six-company consortium that will build a [1]high-bandwidth sub-sea fiber
optic cable linking the US and Japan. The new cable system, named Unity,
is expected initially to increase Trans-Pacific lit cable capacity by
about 20 percent, with the potential to add up to 7.68 Terabits per
second of bandwidth across the Pacific. The name Unity was chosen to
signify a new type of consortium, born out of potentially competing
systems, to emerge as a system within a system, offering ownership and
management of individual fiber pairs. Rumors that Google would join the
consortium had originally surfaced in September last year but the company
had [2]declined to confirm or deny the news.""

Tactical Ground Reporting System, or TIGR allows patrol leaders in Iraq

officers in Iraq ��� about a fifth of patrol leaders ��� are using the
map-centric application before going on patrol and adding new data to
TIGR upon returning. By clicking on icons and lists, they can see the
locations of key buildings, like mosques, schools, and hospitals, and
retrieve information such as location data on past attacks, geotagged
photos of houses and other buildings (taken with cameras equipped with
Global Positioning System technology), and photos of suspected insurgents
and neighborhood leaders. They can even listen to civilian interviews and
watch videos of past maneuvers. ""The ability ... to draw the route ... of
your patrol that day and then to access the collective reports, media,
analysis of the entire organization, is pretty powerful,"" says Major
Patrick Michaelis. ""It is a bit revolutionary from a military perspective
when you think about it, using peer-based information to drive the next
move. ... Normally we are used to our higher headquarters telling the
patrol leader what he needs to think.""""

Regular Slashdot contributor Bennett Haselton has some opinions on child
safety online and the use of fear mongering. Here are his thoughts. ""The
[0]National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has been running
online ads for several years saying that ""Each year 1 in 5 children is
sexually solicited online"", a statistic that has been endlessly repeated,
including by [1]vendors of blocking software and by politicians who often
[2]paraphrase it to say that 1 in 5 children ""are approached by online
predators"". While others have quietly [3]documented the problems with
this statistic, lawmakers still bring it out every year in a push for
more online regulation (preempted this year only by the topic du jour of
[4]cyberbullying), so it's time for anti-censorship organizations to
start campaigning more aggressively against the misleading ""1 in 5""
number. That means two things: framing the debate with more accurate
numbers, and holding the parties accountable for disseminating the wrong
ones -- and that means naming names, including those of organizations
like the NCMEC that are normally beyond reproach."" Read below for the
rest.

paid people to hold places in line for its employees. But Save The
Internet claims that people were bussed in by Comcast and then [2]took up
almost all available seats in the meeting room 90 minutes before the
meeting opened, blocking scores of interested people from attending. Such
tactics are not unheard of in Washington DC, but how appropriate are they
in a regional meeting on a college campus?

""... encouraged in __3.x guidelines__ to ..."": I presume although I've not 
found them yet that there is some kind of document for developers titled 
something like, ""how to migrate your Python code from 2.x to 3.x"".  That 
document would be a logical place for advice and consideration of the 
tradeoffs of jumping to 3.x, maintaining two synced versions using 2to3 or 
3to2, and the risks of keeping two independent releases.  Identifying best 
practices would help them make good choices for the community.

So we don't have an actual success story of a dual-version distribution, even 
as a prototype, using 2to3 within a distutils package?  I would not encourage 
a practice without at least one such example.

Since the precise API was not documented well and many people began to make 
use of ambiguous internal interfaces, such fixes would indeed break them.  So 
your vote would be to do the right thing, even if it results in some breakage. 
  I can respect that philosophy.

Unfortunately no.  Much of it is anecdotal, much of it occurs on lists outside 
the Python community by those attempting to package things.  And some of it 
are comments by developers who peeked into the distutils source and blanched.

And some of the problems are not bugs, per se, but disagreement on scope of 
functionality and a lack of well-known alternatives.  So just ""fix it if 
broken"" doesn't work when there is no agreement on how to expand that scope.

I am working on pulling together such a list however, and getting it into the 
tracker, so that debate with a record of decisions can occur.  I agree that it 
is hard to fix problems if no one is _clearly_ reporting them to us.  Too much 
smoke, not enough light.

Pardon my lack of knowledge of your background; when you say it always worked 
fine for you, are you referring to personal experiences using it to _install_ 
software or to experiences as a packager in actually distributing complex 
collections of modules on different platforms?

Constraints Journal
Special Issue on Abstraction and Automation in Constraint Modelling

Guest Editors

+ Alan M Frisch, University of York, UK.
+ Ian Miguel, University of St Andrews, UK.

Introduction

Constraint Programming (CP) is a powerful technology that has been
successfully used for tackling a wide range of real-life, complex
applications. To solve a problem with CP it first needs to be modelled
by a set of constraints that must be satisfied by any solution.
Because formulating such a model, and especially formulating one that
is solvable in practice, is often difficult, CP technology is
currently accessible to only a small number of experts. For CP to be
more widely used by non-experts, more research effort is needed in
order to ease the use of CP technology.

One way of improving usability is by extending CP technology to enable
models to be formulated at a higher level of abstraction. For
instance, support for set variables (variables whose domain values are
sets) in many constraint languages and solvers has abstracted away
from the low-level details of how the set variable is represented; the
user no longer needs to know these details. However, variables that
take certain other types of values, such as functions and relations,
are not yet supported directly by constraint solvers. In this case,
the abstract variable can be refined into a representation that
comprises a set of more primitive variables and a collection of
constraints among them. In order to avoid forcing the user to perform
this step manually, automated refinement is a key goal.

Automation can also aid the modelling process by transforming a
constraint model into one that can be solved more effectively.  Such
transformations include adding implied constraints, adding
symmetry-breaking constraints, adding constraints to exploit
dominances in optimisation problems, removing propagation-redundant
constraints and creating relaxed versions of the initial problem.

This special issue is devoted to the development and use of
abstraction and automation facilities in constraint modelling.
We invite submissions from interested authors in this
challenging and important area.

Topics of Interest include, but are not limited to:

+ The use of abstraction facilities in formulating models.
+ Abstraction in constraint languages.
+ Abstract variable domains.
+ Abstraction in search control.
+ Automated refinement.
+ Automated generation of implied constraints.
+ Automated generation of symmetry-breaking constraints.
+ Automated generation of constraints to exploit dominances.
+ Automated generation of relaxations.

Maybe regrtest should gain a -3 flag.  All it would have to do is restart
itself moving the -3 from after regrtest to before it.

So, you delete it every time, even when there are no updates?  And since
updates occur about once or twice a month, you are downloading the same
stuff over and over.  Plus you are missing rules at certain points of
the cycle....

true, but you could just find the real problem (permissions) and fix it.

I wasn't very clear. What I posted earlier was by way
of a proof-of-concept and did indeed use a ""remove""
function. After other people's +1 I have put together
a possible patch which does what you're suggesting.
I haven't posted it yet and I need to work through
the test files checking what the impact would be.

I like your second suggestion BTW, altho' I'd
probably skip the ""if os.name == 'nt'"" line
and just give it a try in any case.

Actually, I believe IronPython and/or Jython have to use this trick in
certain cases -- at least I recall Jim Hugunin talking about
generating different code when the use of locals() was detected.

I'm not proud of this, but I don't see a way around it. The
alternative would be to make it a keyword, which seemed excessive
(plus, it would be odd if super() were a keyword when self is not).
There were long discussions about various possible ways to implement
something like this, and they all had their downsides. (The PEP still
isn't fixed to describe the status quo.)

I don't mind this at all -- it's a name starting and ending with
double underscores, so you shouldn't use it except for its defined
semantics, which happen to be exactly what super needs. (I would have
proposed __super__() to get an exception for that too, except that
it's excessively ugly.)

You don't have to explain it that way at all. First you explain how
the 2.x super(C, self) works. Then you explain that if you call it
with no arguments, the arguments default to the current class object
and the first argument of the current function. Only people wanting to
write their own interpreter need to know more.

To Facundo, who asks if we need super() at all: yes, we need it. You
can't write decent multiple-inheritance code without it.

Thank you for the reply and your time. 

It has been about a week now since I removed the problematic address 
(qz_gieuxno@my_mail_provider.org) from the whitelist database and started 
over. Initial tests have proved positive, no wrong AWL scores. The trust path 
is correct by the way, no ALL_TRUSTED tests fire nor do I observe any of the 
symptoms described on the wiki page.

But that was a week ago, and now I am back to the square one it seems. I just 
posted to the Dovecot mailing list and found that when retrieving the message 
from the remote mailserver (the one that hosts the problematic address) via 
getmail the AWL test got a score of over 9.5. 

Looking through my Received Spam folder I see lots of spams which seem to have 
come from me, i.e. ""From: qz_gieuxno@my_mail_provider.org"". 

Now as far as I understand AWL looks at both the sender address 
(qz_gieuxno@my_mail_provider.org) and the IP the mail came from, right? 

So it would seem that Spamassassin on my server looks at the sender address 
(qz_gieuxno@my_mail_provider.org) and the IP address of the server the 
(possible) spam comes from. In my case the only IP address that could be 
looked at is the IP address of the remote mailserver, i.e. that of 
my_mail_provider.org (85.214.xx.yy). This is clearly not the desired 
behaviour.

That would explain why the AWL score would become ever higher with every spam 
(that has my address in the From: field) received on the remote mailserver 
and then retrieved by me on my local mailserver. The mail address/IP address 
pair would always be the same, no matter where the original spam originated 
from.

I hope I could make clear what I am thinking. Am I thinking correctly? Is this 
what is happening? If so, how do I solve this problem? 

I really can't be having all legitimate mail sent to mailing lists by me end 
up in the Spam folder just because some spammers put my address in the From: 
field.

I'd really appreciate any further insight on this.

The

  I'm a Japanese, and I'm bothered for years! I maintained a patch to print
Japanese strings collect for a long time.

In Japan(and China, Korea and other lot of countries), most text data
are built with non-Latin characters. For example, my name 'Atsuo
Ishimoto' is written in four Kanji characters(""\\u77f3\\u672c\\u6566\\u592b""),
and my address 'Koshigaya city, Saitama' is also written in some
kanji characters.
Custom for-loop for debug works, but I definitely prefer Unicode-friendly
repr().

I got the same message after clicking WebTV on Mandriva (Spring 2007). It's
a bit disappointing that one of the major Irish broadcasters doesn't support
Linux at all. At least RTE just requires a RealPlayer Plugin.

Looks like it might have been generated by whatever these guys are using:

http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/spamassassin-users/200708.mbox/%4n283494750276.11412.i_hcxmn@012.net.il%3E

Looks like there's some kind of exim setup that does this..

Based on that I can make these guesses:

 X-Spam-Score seems to be score *10, and truncated instead of rounded. 
This accounts for how -6.6 can become -65.. (-6.58 will round to -6.6, 
but multiply and truncate and you get -65)

X-Spam-Bar probably generates a series of - or + signs for each full 
point of score in that direction. (similar to SA's _STARS(*)_ tag, but 
with negative scores represented). It's a wild guess, but seems reasonable.

Enrique Perez-Terron <iaysv@online.no>,zqoqi@spamassassin.apache.org,"Wed, 06 Aug 2008 03:31:33 +0000","Html font invisible or ""low contrast"" - no score?","I am trying to figure out why almost all spam continues to get through. I 
use 
  Fedora 8, 
  Evolution 2.12.3, and 
  spamassassin 3.2.4

I have marked as junk, respectively as non-junk, more than 100 mails of 
each kind. Probably more than 200 by now.

I have saved to a file the source of one typical example spam.
This mail contains sequences like

   rqz 

embedded in the middle of ""sensitive"" words. That makes the word look like

  spa       massa      ssin

(substitute your favorite merchandise). The sequence above selects white 
letters on a white background, and in addition, makes the letters rather 
small, two pixels high. In this way the words that would otherwise 
trigger a filter rule, get split and the pieces are separated by other 
words or letter combinations; yet those other words do not show up on the 
screen.

Googling around I found a list of Spamassassin tests, including

   Area tested:   body
   Description:   HTML font color similar to background
   Test name:     HTML_FONT_LOW_CONTRAST
   Default score: 
    local:        0.131 
    net:          0.543 
    bayes:        0.663 
    bayes + net:  0.124

(I do not understand these scores. Why are they different? When do they 
apply - eg. does the 'local' value apply if I run ""spamassassin --local""? 
But if so, why is a low font contrast less significant when --local is 
used? etc.)

There was also another test named HTML_FONT_INVISIBLE, but I later found 
this test appears to be assiociated with earlier versions of spamassassin.

Since Evolution runs ""spamc --local"", I tried ""spamassassin --local"" and 
looked at the output. Here is one:

  X-Spam-Status: No, score=3.4 required=5.0 tests=AWL,DATE_IN_PAST_24_48,
	HS_INDEX_PARAM,HTML_MESSAGE,RDNS_NONE autolearn=no version=3.2.4

There is no indication of the low-contrast rule having been triggered.  
Should this be so? Is this header supposed to show all tests with non-
zero scores?  How can I have spamassassin give me a complete list of 
tests with nonzero scores?

I added lines to my .spamassassin/user_prefs

  score HTML_FONT_INVISIBLE 9.99
  score HTML_FONT_LOW_CONTRAST 9.99

but could not see any change.

Then I tried to look at the source code. I found a function 
""html_font_invisible"", which starts by computing the foreground and 
background colors. I inserted an extra line of code to have the function 
log its determinations. Here is some of the output:

  backgroud:#ffffff foreground:#000000
  backgroud:#ffffff foreground:#ffffff
  backgroud:#ffffff foreground:#000000
  backgroud:#ffffff foreground:#ffffff
  backgroud:#ffffff foreground:#000000
  backgroud:#ffffff foreground:#ffffff
  backgroud:#ffffff foreground:#000000
  backgroud:#ffffff foreground:#000000
  backgroud:#ffffff foreground:#000000
  backgroud:#ffffff foreground:#ffffff
  backgroud:#ffffff foreground:#000000

That is, the function assumes the background is white, and correctly 
finds that the text color is sometimes black, sometimes white.

This shows that Spamassassin does run that code, and does correctly 
determine that some of the text has the same color as the background.

However, finding one's way through all of spamassassin's code is likely 
to be a monumental task, so I wish to ask if somebody knows anything 
about this problem.

Further googling turned up some discussions showing that the combination 
fedora+evolution+junk-filtering had more complaints than e.g. ubuntu. 
However, I did not see any resolution (the web server went offline).

Any ideas? Any pointers?

Thanks

Initial Comment:
First off, this is one of the best programs for Anti-
SPAM I've seen.  Kudos to all...

When in Junk E-Mail the available Button is [Recover 
from Spam] which I've clicked I really meant to DELETE 
them from Junk E-Mail Folder.  (Done this several 
times and may be due to contantly using the [Delete As 
Spam] while in Inbox.)

Could there be a warning that I'm restoring junk 
emails into Inbox or add a [Delete Junk] along with 
[Recover...].

Just though I mention it.

Thanks for all your work...

If you do accidentally click the wrong button, all you need to is locate
the item in the inbox and click on the ""Delete as Spam"" button - that
completely undoes the accident.  Given that is so easy to recover from, I
don't think it is worth adding as option for this.

I don't see how it could work if any Python code is executed in the
module, since code execution uses a dict for globals.

Supporting it only for built-in modules seems too big an exception.

So I'm -0.

Ok, thanks. I didn't also check -DDEBUGGING but it was bound to happen
at some point.

In that vein, I think the monthly alphas may also help as a means for 
setting personal deadlines for things we're working on. ""Implement for 
2.6"" is a bit of a wishy-washy deadline at some vague point in the 
future - it doesn't provide much impetus to sit down and spend an 
afternoon or evening getting it done. ""Implement for next 2.6 alpha, 
which will be cut in 3 weeks, 2 days and 16 hours"" is a real concrete 
target that can be aimed for (even if I'm the only person that knows I'm 
aiming for it for a given bug fix or feature).

It should also motivate at least a monthly review of the buildbot 
status, and is already motivating a push towards making the buildbots a 
more reliable indicator of the health of the source tree.

Sure, they may mostly be internal milestones (with third parties waiting 
for a feature-complete alpha or the first beta), but I think there is a 
decent chance the approach will turn out to be beneficial.

Cheers,
Nick.

No, and yes. Many of the zope3 modules are installable as separate
modules. Zope 3 in general has been ""eggified"". This is not however
how everybody installs Zope3. Zope2 is not installed this way. Also,
most Zope2 products are not modules installed by setup.py.

I repeat: There is no setup.py install to run.

*************************************************************************

Knowledge Representation is one of the major topics in AI. Its concerns
are (logical) formalisms and reasoning, with the intention to explore and
model the basics of intelligent behaviour. In recent years, intelligent
agents in the contexts of open environments and multi agent systems have
become the leading paradigm of the field. Consequently, modern KR methods
have to deal not only with static scenarios, but also with dynamic
modifications in knowledge and belief, due to uncertain or incomplete
information, or to changes in the environment. Moreover, agents are often
expected to learn from past experiences, or to  interact with other
agents, making use of their knowledge and adjusting their beliefs during
argumentation. 

The focus of this workshop is on dynamic processes concerning any changes
that an agent's state of knowledge and belief may undergo. Modelling the
continuous cycle of acquiring and applying  knowledge is of particular
interest, so work on relating learning and knowledge representation will
be considered particularly useful. Moreover, the effects of belief changes
on the agent's decisions and behaviour is also within the scope of the
workshop.
   
We welcome papers on the following and any related topics: 
     * Belief revision and belief update
     * Nonmonotonic reasoning
     * Learning and knowledge discovery in data
     * Argumentation theories
     * Decision theory and preferences
     * Action and change

Hi,

I've been working on some changes that allow me to use tte.py on

Kegelmaster

Following the birth of their children, Maree Fruhstorfer 
and Michelle Witehira were very concerned at the lack 
of information available on the subject of restoring 
their pelvic floor muscles.



Traditional ""kegel"" (squeeze and hold) exercises 
proved to be ineffective, so after searching the globe in 
the hope of finding a product to help with incontinence, 
prolapse and sexual problems they discovered the 
Kegelmaster. 



The Kegelmaster is a small progressive resistance- 
based vaginal exerciser specifically developed to 
target the pelvic floor muscles. Based on the research 
of the late Dr Arnold Kegel, the Kegelmaster works by 
perfecting the pelvic floor exercise ""the kegel"". Now 
endorsed by medical experts around the globe, it 
offers women an alternative. 



Kegelmaster New Zealand Limited is the New 
Zealand distributor of the genuine, patented 
Kegelmaster.

Playhouse Disney's Bunnytown

Playhouse Disney's Bunnytown is a laugh-packed TV 
show for preschoolers set in a fantastical bunny-filled 
world that invites viewers to experience life from a 
bunny point of view.



Like all Playhouse Disney programming, ""Bunnytown"" 
is guided by an established curriculum that nurtures 
multiple areas of child development: physical, 
emotional, social and cognitive. Bunnytown's jokes 
and laughable situations are designed to coincide 
with lessons learnt in every day life, such as how to 
get dressed correctly or matching animals with the 
sounds they make.



 The series also takes early academic skills such as 
counting, shapes and vocabulary and places them in 
a humorous context so that you and your preschooler 
can truly laugh and learn together. 



Watch Bunnytown only on Playhouse Disney on SKY, 
weekends at 12:30pm and 6:30pm or find more 
activities and information on our website (http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001hTW_N87zj9C0Y_RO4VIooTFIzEYlMeu2xE_NPbdm5p8qUHBArhRY9wXzSgxfZVS0HE88_NpU9amrTxsij9ql7MNqIbs42N_upLfML-sxPDBMx5iP-8zwzg==)

Mountain Buggy - Exercise Tip For The Month

BEING FIT AND HEALTHY



Tips for getting slim, trim and fit are drinking lots 
of water, not eating between meals, not eating when 
your not hungry, avoiding  the inevitable eating scraps 
off your kids plates and using any opportunity you get 
for exercise, whether it be parking further when you 
park at the shopping mall or playing soccer with the 
kids in the park.



Make it a lifestyle choice and aim to get fit and healthy.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Star Sign - Taurus 21 April-21 May


The Taurus child is resolute, practical, obstinate, 
and 
conservative. He or she is reliable and careful in 
speech and action.



Taurus children can be known to hold back emotions 
and desires until provocation releases them. Taurus 
children who are taught to control their emotional 
outbursts can develop into sensitive, intuitive people.


The Taurus child loves beauty and harmony and 
loathes disorganization. Taurus children are also 
generous, kindhearted, trustworthy, and intensely 
strong willed. They love the good things in life but are 
rarely overly dramatic or charismatic.



A Taurus child will be gifted with many talents. He or 
she will be good at executive work and being in 
charge of others as well as with things to do with the 
earth, such as real estate, mining, and oil fields. 
Taurus is often competent in positions of trust and 
confidence, such as a doctor, nurse, or judge. Even 
though practicality is a strong part of the Taurus 
makeup, Taurus can also make wonderful artists, 
especially in the fields of architecture, interior design, 
and textiles.






~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some Thoughts on Kids by Mothers

You can fool some of the people all of the time and all 
of the people some of the time, but you can never fool 
mum.



 A child's greatest period of growth is the month after
you've purchased new school clothes.



Children seldom misquote you. In fact, they usually 
repeat word for word what you shouldn't have said.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dyslexia Awareness Week June 2008

Dyslexia Week is fast approaching and the theme this 
year is 'Dyslexia - A Blessing in Disguise"".  This is all 
about promoting greater understanding and 
acceptance of dyslexia as an alternative way of 
thinking that can bring creative gifts as well as some 
learning challenges.  The theme refers to 
the ""blessing"" of creativity as well as the difficulties 
and coping strategies which are the ""disguise"".



Last year, the Dyslexia 'IS REAL'  campaign was a 
huge success, with the Government formally 
recognising dyslexics, and the Ministry of Education 
beginning a work programme to address dyslexia in 
schools. The Dyslexia Foundation of NZ want to build 
on the gains that were made and help everyone to 
understand that dyslexia is so much more than a 
range of learning difficulties.  After all, dyslexia is often 
found in the most creative places, amongst artists, 
musicians, actors and chefs!



To find out more visit The Dyslexia Foundation 
of NZ (http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001hTW_N87zj9Dqtafxef7vkj2XXK93hp8YkqH4Za7R6bnY45Za5w_3D_TrXmCumifkd7cQ4vKCS800L27zpM971FDE3pbNswXMHydaHOMYWFE=) website.

I'll need to hand merge this as it won't apply to the latest CPAN

I was thinking along these lines too, although I don't know if it's 
worth the effort.  But one certainly could make ->can() and method 
resolution skip stubs in the absence of AUTOLOAD, confining the current 
behavior to modules that actually use AUTOLOAD.  It would add some 
method resolution overhead, but not too much as this stuff gets cached 
after its first use (at least, up until it gets redefined again).

                     10-12 May 2006, Umeå (Sweden)
                       http://sais2006.cs.umu.se/ 


The 23rd annual workshop of the Swedish Artificial Intelligence Society (SAIS)
will take place in Umeå, Sweden on May 10-12, 2006. This meeting follows the
2005 meeting in Västerås in which the Swedish Society for Learning Systems
(SSLS) was officially merged into SAIS. SAIS provides an ideal forum to foster
contacts among AI research groups in Sweden and neighboring countries, as well
as to establish links with related research disciplines and industry.

This year's program will feature the following invited speakers:

    * Klaus-Peter Adlassnig (Medical University of Vienna, Austria)
    * Gerhard Brewka (University of Leipzig, Germany)
    * Hector Geffner (Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Spain)
    * Jérôme Lang (Université Paul Sabatier, France)


The SAIS program committee invites submissions of research and application
papers on all aspects of Artificial Intelligence. Example areas include, but
are not limited to:

    * Artificial Intelligence in Medicine
    * Automated Reasoning
    * Biologically Inspired Algorithms
    * Data Mining
    * Decision Support Systems
    * Knowledge Based Systems
    * Machine Learning
    * Machine Vision
    * Multi-Agent Systems
    * Natural Language Processing
    * Ontologies
    * Planning and Scheduling
    * Probabilistic Reasoning
    * Robotics
    * Search

We invite two types of contributions:

REGULAR PAPERS: These papers will be carefully reviewed; accepted papers will be
published in the workshop proceedings (copyright stays with author). These
papers are not to exceed 10 pages (A4, single column, 12 point font) including
references.

SHORT PAPERS: These papers will be reviewed; accepted papers will be published
in the workshop proceedings. The main purpose of such papers is to communicate
research activities of individuals and groups in Sweden and neighboring
countries. These papers are to be 1-4 pages (A4, single column, 12 point font)
including references.

All submissions must be in PDF and must be written in English. Please send
papers to wevj3126@cs.umu.se and include an abstract (in ASCII) in the main
message body of the initial submission.

Copyright stays with the authors. Authors of previously unpublished papers
accepted to SAIS 2006 are encouraged to submit these papers to other
workshops/conferences.

Papers may be accepted for oral presentation or as posters.


IMPORTANT DATES:

    * Paper submission: February 19, 2006
    * Notification of acceptance: April 3, 2006
    * Accepted paper submission: April 23, 2006
    * SAIS event: May 10-12, 2006


VENUE:

Umeå is the largest city in the northern half of Sweden and is unofficially
known as the 'capital of Norrland.' With a population of 110,000, of which
25,000 are students, Umeå is a young city, with many cultural and recreational
activities.

As it happens, the 9 day festival ""MADE in Umeå"" will start immediately after
SAIS2006 on May 12th. MADE stands for music, art, dance, etc and is a large
international music festival, where artists from all over the world and from
different music genres get together to celebrate cultural and musical diversity
(see http://www.botniamusik.se/ for further details).

For those interested in outdoor activities, Umeå lies on the shores of a rather
large river (900 cubic meter / second) and is 15 km from the Baltic Sea. This
river is full of salmon, which may be seen jumping a salmon stair by Norrfors
dam, 15 km upstream. The record for salmon passing in one year is 7089 fish.
Fishing and rafting are possible within one hour from downtown.

The SAIS workshop will be held on the campus of Umeå University in the MIT-Huset
building.


PROGRAM COMMITTEE:

    * Christian Balkenius (Lund University)

***********************************************************************

			CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

	    Evaluation of Probabilistic Inference Systems

 				at the

   22nd Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI)
		     July 13th - July 16th, 2006
      Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA
    http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/~bilmes/uai06InferenceEvaluation

***********************************************************************


Over the years, many different algorithms for making queries of
probability distributions represented by graphical models have been
developed. There are now a number of algorithms for exact inference
(e.g., junction-tree based schemes using graph triangulations, search
or conditioning based approaches based on SAT/CSP techniques), and
approximation methods (including variational, generalized belief
propagation, and sampling schemes).  Also, aspects of software
implementation, such as relevant data structures, memory management,
and subsidiary algorithms, can have a significant effect on actual
runtime.

The purpose of this evaluation is to compare the performance of a
variety of different software systems on a single set of Bayesian
network (BN) problems. A number of different Bayesian networks will be
made available to each participant, and each will be evaluated
according to the following:

  1. Exact inference only. While approximate inference is crucial
     in many problem domains, recent results have shown that exact
     inference can still be performed on a variety of interesting
     (and thought previously to be intractable) problems. Therefore,
     this first UAI competition will involve systems that perform
     exact inference only (meaning everyone's probability score
     should be numerically identical).

  2. Evaluation will involve both wall-clock run time, and
     amount of memory used. Both fastest time with a memory ceiling,
     and smallest memory with a time limit will be evaluated.

  3. Several forms of query will be possible to evaluate, including
     Probability(evidence) (i.e., summing out hidden variables), MPE,
     and MAP. The resulting scores/assignments for all queries must be
     correct and accurate.

  4. A set of complete Bayesian network models will be made available.
     Some of the BNs will be strictly positive (meaning there will
     be no zeros in the CPTs). Other BNs will be mixtures
     of dense, sparse, and deterministic CPTs.
    
  5. We will evaluate only single threaded performance (i.e., no
     multi-threading or parallelism in this first evaluation).  We
     will use the same underlying (Intel-class) microprocessor running
     the Linux operating system for all systems. Each process will
     have a 2GB memory limitation.

  6. Two types of BNs will be evaluated, static and dynamic
     (as in dynamic Bayesian networks). They will be placed in a
     standard easy-to-read format (to be determined).

We encourage each participant (or any interested party) to submit a
BN of their own to be considered for evaluation (but we do not make
guarantees that any particular BN will be used).  All the resulting
BNs used in the competition, and all results, will be listed on the
UAI web after the competition is over (this will encourage continued
standardized evaluation).


IMPORTANT DATES:

   5/1/06       - Deadline date to express your intent to participate. You should
                  also indicate which of Pr(evidence), MPE and/or MAP you wish to 
                  evaluate.
   5/15/06      - Deadline date to submit a BN and query type for consideration for 
                  participation. Not all submissions will necessarily be used.
   5/30/06      - Date that final list of BNs, their format, and timing
                  details will be made available.
   6/12-23/06   - Evaluation period, during this time, participants will be given
                  access to a compute server on which they may compile and evaluate
                  their system.
   6/23/06      - Final results are due, along with verification script.
   7/14/06      - Evaluation results announced at UAI'06

Using this configuration user1@mydomain1 cannot pretend he is a 
different user. For example, he cannot send an email saying he is 
user2@mydomain2.

Question1: How can i exclude a user from this rule based on his IP? in 
main.cf i've added: mynetworks=127.0.0.1, his_ip_address but it does not 
work.

Question2: The rule above works fine for all users when they use a 
webmail client or any other client. The only problem is with users who 
use squirrelmail. They still can send emails with a fake ""from address""! 
Postfix cannot stop them.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance,

I've spent three weeks off and on trying to get my laptop (openSuSE 10.3) to 
connect to the internet through my cell phone.

For the most part, I've been trying to use umtsmon, as suggested in the 
opensuse Wiki.

I've tried both bluetooth and USB cable. umtsmon authors are not sure why it 
doesn't work (I've been asking on the umtsmon mailing list).

My current cell phone is a Nokia 6555, I'm with AT&T (former Cingular) and 
have the unlimited ""DataConnect"" plan. It works fine on OS X through 
bluetooth, and also works fine with my HP iPaq (Windows Mobile 2003). So I 
know the phone works ok. I'm not able to make the Mac connect using the USB 
cable, but that might just be because I don't know what I'm doing. It works 
just fine using bluetooth.

At this point I'm not so worried about making umtsmon work, I just want some 
way to connect, doesn't matter what combination of scripts and software I 
use, or even if I need to get a different cell phone. 

Has *anyone* in the U.S.A been able to make their SuSE connect to the internet 
through their mobile phone? If so, what did you do to make it work?

Thanks,

I think there is a datasheet on the conrad website in 8-9 different

I'm pretty certain it won't be able to measure any spikes.  As for the
type of load, it's almost 99% resistive.  I.e. the load doesn't vary
with the phase of the AC.

I think the load on the mains supply is actually pretty straight.

Hmmm, I could do that, but I've only got a normal scope (no storage), so
I'd have to sit and watch it.  Maybe.

Abstract
========


    A number of hot research topics are currently sharing the 
common problem of combining concurrent, distributed, mobile and 
heterogenous components, trying to harness the intrinsic 
complexity of the resulting systems. These include coordination, 
peer-to-peer systems, grid computing, web-services, multi-agent 
systems, and component-based systems. Coordination languages and 
software architectures are recognised as fundamental approaches 
to tackle these issues, improving software productivity, 
enhancing maintainability, advocating modularity, promoting 
reusability, and leading to systems more tractable and more 
amenable to verification and global analysis. The goal of this 
workshop is to put together researchers and practitioners of the 
aforementioned fields, to share and identify common problems, and 
to devise general solutions in the contexts of coordination 
languages and software architectures.


Topics of interest
==================

    Topics of interest include (but are not limited to): 

        * Theoretical models (coordination, component 
          composition, concurrency, semantics, expressiveness); 

        * Specification, refinement, and analysis of software 
          systems (architectures, patterns and styles, 
          verification of functional and non-functional 
          properties); 

        * Languages for interaction, coordination, architectures, 
          and interface definition (implementation, 
          interoperability, heterogeneity); 

        * Dynamic software architectures (mobile agents, 
          self-organizing/adaptive/reconfigurable systems); 

        * Tools and environments for the development of 
          applications. 


     In particular, practice, experience and methodologies from 
the following areas are solicited as well:

                    - Web-services 
                    - Multi-agent systems 
                    - Peer-to-peer systems 
                    - Grid computing 
                    - Component-based systems


Call for Papers
===============



    FOCLASA 2005 is a satellite workshop of the 16th 
International Conference on Concurrency Theory (CONCUR 2005). The 
workshop will be held at same location as CONCUR 2005 on August 
27, 2005, one day after the main conference. The workshop tries 
to provide a venue where researchers and practitioners on the 
topics above can meet, exchange ideas and problems, identify some 
of the key and fundamental issues related to coordination 
languages and software architecture, and explore together and 
disseminate solutions.

   FOCLASA 2005 invites the submission of technical papers in any 
of the topics of interest and areas listed above.  Submissions 
must describe authors’ original research work and their results. 
Description of work-in-progress is also encouraged. The 
contributions should not exceed 15 pages formatted according to 
the style of the Electronic Notes on Theoretical Computer Science 
(ENTCS), and should be emailed as PostScript (PS) or Portable 
Document Format (PDF) files to foclasa05@lcc.uma.es.

    All submissions will be reviewed by an international program 
committee that will select them for presentation in the workshop. 
Selected papers will be available through the workshop website, 
and a printed version of the proceedings will be distributed 
among participants during the workshop. The proceedings of 
the workshop will be published in Electronic Notes in Theoretical 
Computer Science (ENTCS).  

    Participants will make a presentation of their papers (about 
twenty or twenty five minutes maximum), followed by a five to ten 
minutes round of questions and discussion on participants’ work. 
The workshop will also include a closing panel in which several 
issues related to the topics of the workshop and some issues 
raised during the workshop will be discussed. The Panel Chair 
(to determine) will invite the panelists and moderate the debate.


    The publication of a special issue on FOCLASA 2005 in an 
international scientific journal is also being prepared. Selected 
participants will be invited to submit an extended version of 
their papers after the workshop. These extended versions will be 
reviewed by an international program committee, which will decide 
on their final publication on the special issue. Previous editions 
of FOCLASA have been published on Fundamenta Informaticae and 
Science of Computer Programming.

Exploiting IT Networks to Create Sticky Services
Sponsored by: Alcatel-Lucent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The service realm is evolving and expanding at a rapid rate with new
applications and services being developed at a dizzying pace in order
to exploit the capabilities of end-to-end IP networks. There are a
number of sticky services that are deployable over advanced IP
networks and there is no risk in doing so. Business and residential
services are going to continue to evolve under the momentum of this
innovation and individual services are going to move towards a
converged Service Delivery Environment (SDE). 

This paper details a carrier-grade SDE solution that allows you to
accelerate service innovation for personalized and blended services
through an open framework that links operator and partner
applications with shared network resources, service enhancements and
operations.

Seamless Physical and Virtual Server Management
Sponsored by: HP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As enterprise demand for new applications and capabilities shows no
sign of slowing, neither do most IT budgets show any sign of
expanding to match the need. Enterprises are turning to
virtualization to maximize platform resources, and the approach is
spreading beyond application development and testing labs to
production systems' including application and Web server
infrastructures. This white paper details how you can benefit from
virtualization and the best way to manage a virtualized system.

Addressing Document Imaging Security Issues

Document imaging makes it possible to integrate paper documents with
existing workflow processes and business applications, e.g., e-mail,
fax, and electronic document management systems. But before
introducing paper into electronic-based processes, you want to be
sure that document imaging is safe and document integration secure.
This white paper details how to ensure that your e-documents and the
management of those documents are secure.

Hi

As part of my PhD research I am compiling a list of ads (most commonly TV ads) that appear to show something about New Zealand national identity. I am hoping to get responses from immigrants and NZ born people.

If you have a view on brand ads that seem to YOU to show distinctive things about national identity, ""Kiwiness"" or New Zealand life and culture I would be very pleased to hear about it.

I am equally open to comments about ads that you have noticed that are irritating / unbelievable that seem to make some claim to be genuinely NZ relevant / for New Zealand consumers.

Thanks for taking the trouble to read this.

Cheers Sandy

I bought a USB wireless adaptor (Intellinet) to connect to my Buffalo wireless/router modem. I installed the Atheros drivers but when I plug the USB adaptor my Ubuntu (7.04) pc freezes, I can boot it but stops at the logon screen. If I plug the key after the system is up, the system runs very slowly, I managed to run the top command and the network-manager is consumming 98% of the CPU. The system is so slow that I cannot check logs...
Any pointers? 
Thanks
Fred

Otherwise we  would have offered it some time ago. 6in4 is not really the way forward.

Also a lot of european universities have migrated to  IPv6 over the last years.

Neil Lawrence <gmrw@dcs.shef.ac.uk>,faq@engr.orst.edu,"Thu, 07 Aug 2008 04:04:37 +0100",[UAI] Workshop: Gaussian Processes in Practice,"Registration is now open for the following workshop:

Gaussian Processes in Practice
Bletchley Park, U.K.  (where the Enigma machine was decoded)
12th & 13th June 2006

There has been a recent upsurge in interest in Gaussian processes for 
solving a variety of machine learning problems. Simultaneously there 
have been recent rapid developments in efficient approximation 
techniques for Gaussian processes and novel unifying theories of 
existing approximation techniques.

This workshop will bring experts in Gaussian processes together with 
individuals who are using Gaussian processes at the forefront of 
research in their fields. We will start with a set of talks that will 
relate the latest developments in Gaussian processes while the second 
portion of talks will discuss application fields where Gaussian 
processes are being applied as state-of-the-art technologies: Robotics, 
Graphics and Vision.

Speakers Include:

David MacKay
Carl Rasmussen
Ed Snelson
Chris Williams

Dieter Fox
Aaron Hertzmann
Raquel Urtasun

The workshop is expected to be an ideal entry point to a researcher 
interested in using Gaussian processes, but at the same time, by 
bringing together acknowledged experts in Gaussian processes with 
acknowledged experts in the application areas mentioned above we expect 
to drive forward research in novel directions.

We invite submissions to the workshop of *no more than four pages* in 
length using the LaTeX article class file in one column with standard 
margin settings and 11pt font.

The submission deadline is Friday May 19th. It is our intention to 
create a post-proceedings for the workshop.

Registration for the workshop will close on Friday 26th May.

That's not much of a plan. It doesn't discuss any of the effects of
the proposed change on merging code from the 2.6 trunk to the py3k
branch.

So this doesn't address merges at all. Suppose we have some C code
that's shared between 2.6 and 3.0 and manipulates binary data (e.g.
the gzip codec). It currently uses PyString on both branches, so any
changes to the trunk merge smoothly into the py3k branch. But if you
change PyString -> PyBytes in the py3k branch, every change you make
in the 2.6 code will cause a merge conflict. Is that really what you
want? I worry that it will effectively separate the trunk and the py3k
branch, losing the advantage of doing development that effects both at
once.

You would still have to read the entire directory, right?
In that kind of class, there is a number of applications;
e.g. du(1) also wouldn't have to create a list of all files
in the directory, but add the sizes of the files incrementally.

So the question really is whether it is a problem to keep
all file names in memory simultaneously. As Aahz says, the
total memory consumption for a large directory is still
comparatively low, for today's machines.

Martin

In most cases it's easy. Usually it takes me less than 20 minutes per
day to merge the chances from trunk -> py3k. In this particular case
several obstacles come together. The changes in the AST and parser code
aren't trivial, I'm not familiar with the internals of the AST and
parser code and my free time is very limited.

Please don't patch trunk and py3k simultaneously. It may confuse svn and
may make future merges harder. You should apply the patch to the trunk
and either merge or block the revision with svnmerge.

Example:

# Commit a patch to the trunk
~$ cd python/trunk
trunk$ svn ci -m ""Message""
.
Committed revision 1234.

# Merge the revision to the py3k branch
trunk $ cd ../py3k
py3k $ svnmerge.py merge -r 1234
.

# resolve conflicts
.

# commit the merge
py3k $ svn ci -F svnmerge-commit-message.txt

Generally, I use gnuwin32 patch (http://gnuwin32.sf.net), with the
--binary flag. That seems to work most of the time for me. (The cygwin
version may also have --binary).

ICML 2007
24th International Conference on Machine Learning
http://oregonstate.edu/conferences/icml2007/

June 20-24, 2007
Corvallis, Oregon, USA

ICML 2007 invites submission of papers on substantial, original, and
previously unpublished research in all aspects of machine learning.
We welcome submissions of innovative work on systems that are self
adaptive, systems that improve their own performance, or systems that
apply logical, statistical, probabilistic or other formalisms to the
analysis of data, learning predictive models, or interaction with the
environment.  We welcome theoretical contributions, carefully
evaluated empirical studies, and we particularly welcome work that
combines both.  We also encourage submissions that bridge the gap
between machine learning and other fields of research.

ICML 2007 will be co-located with the 17th Annual International
Conference on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP 2007).

***********************

IMPORTANT DATES:
***********************

Feb 7:          Abstract submissions due
Feb 9:          Paper submissions due
Jun 19-21:      ILP Conference (co-located)
Jun 20-24:      ICML Conference

***********************

Format of the Conference

The conference will include three days of technical presentations
along with one day of tutorials and one day of workshops.  The
conference will also feature poster sessions and informal gatherings
designed to foster discussion of research in machine learning.
Accepted papers will each be given an oral presentation and also
featured in evening poster sessions, to allow conference attendees
to discuss the work with the authors at greater length. The ICML
program will also feature talks by several invited speakers.

Paper Submission

The deadline for abstract submissions to ICML 2007 is Wednesday,
February 7th, 2007.  The deadline for full papers is Friday, February
9th, 2007. Abstract submission by the 7th is required for each full
paper; abstracts for which full papers are not submitted will be
ignored. The submission process will be entirely electronic.
Authors should submit papers using the same format and length as will
be required for the final proceedings version. Detailed instructions,

Authors should submit papers using the same format and length as will
be required for the final proceedings version. Detailed instructions,
as well as templates for LaTeX and Word, will be available on the
website.  ICML 2007 will not accept any paper which, at the time of
submission, is under review or has already been accepted for
publication in a journal or another conference. Authors are also
expected not to submit their papers elsewhere during ICML's review
period.

Review Process

Papers submitted to ICML 2007 will normally be reviewed by three (but
at least two) referees. Authors will be given the opportunity to
provide a short feedback to the reviews before the final decision is
made.  Reviewing for ICML 2007 will be blind to the identities of the
authors.

I'm not so sure about that. Evaluating range(N) involves
a global lookup and Python function call, whereas extracting
an iterator from a C-implemented iterable doesn't.

The difference is likely to be even greater when
there are more arguments involved, such as range(m, n, s).

Also, the range may be getting computed elsewhere. There
are notational conveniences to being able to wrap the
description of a range up into a single object
that can be passed around and iterated over easily.

It very much depends on the power supply in question.
Today i would recommend buying one with over 80% efficiency.
These often reach up to 85% efficiency,
but only when they operate around 50% load:
Power Supplies 101: A comprehensive guide Motherboards.org:
http://www.motherboards.org/articles/guides/1487_7.html

The study you quote may be a bit outdated (2002)
or be valid for cheap PSUs (Compaq).
It is certainly good to check the characteristics
of the PSU before you buy one:
http://www.80plus.org/manu/psu/manu_psu.htm

But as seen earlier in this thread,
calculating the power consumption needs
of the components used is not always easy.

Kind regards     Philippe

    Hello Guys,

    I have some rules, applied with body_checks, for blocking some types 
of attachments from arriving in my mail servers. OK, it's working, i can 
see on the logs.

    The basic problem is the fact, well discussed before on this mailing 
list, that the 'REJECT mytexthere' is just issued on the end of the 
message transmission. Message is correctly rejected, but i have no 
bandwidth saving, which would be very interesting as well regarding this 
attachment blocking stuff.

    I know postfix cant simply reply with the REJECT in the middle of 
the message .... RFC things, etc etc, well discussed before.

    The question is ... is there something i can do for acchieving 
bandwidth saving purposes as well as the attachment blocking ?? Is there 
something i can do with postfix for blocking AND stopping the message 
transmission ?

Unfortunately, those won't work, if you plan to use that drive with 
Windows systems.  All my flash drives are formatted FAT32, except for 
one that has an encrypted file system on it.

On the other hand, my USB attached hard drives, one 160 GB and the other 
500 GB are formatted with Reiser 3.

Is that enough time for the buildbots to do their thing and for you to
look at the page?

Alterntaively, I guess you could just suggest that people check the
buildbot page for their platforms before downloading ....

To finish a dissertation, you are expected to move toward distant goals with few concrete milestones. For many, the instinct is to go it alone. Grinding it out in isolation, however, is unlikely to produce your highest-quality work most efficiently.

But, you may ask, what choice do you have? A graduate student's support system can be thin.
Getting time with the busy professors who ostensibly provide our main guidance is not easy. Even
if they are accessible, it makes sense to use their time efficiently. They may expect to review only
polished products and engage in only crucial conversations, rather than assist with everyday
decisions.

The only way to finish your dissertation is through forward progress in the face of uncertainty.
Fortunately, there is a secret weapon to guide you through the confusion, improve your writing, and
help you spend your time wisely. It comes in the form of your peers.

Creating a dissertation-support group made up of fellow doctoral students can enhance your
productivity. How to begin: Find one or two colleagues who are at about the same stage of research
as you are. Meet once a week with the goal of furthering one another's progress.

Having a regular group of people committed to trading services with one another can pay off hugely
through collective improvement in many areas:

* Faster progress: The insights of your peers can be invaluable as you are developing ideas or
writing. Having an audience for practice presentations and brainstorming sessions is helpful
as well. Let's face it: Students' time is cheap compared with precious faculty hours. Maximize
your meetings with professors by preprocessing with your support group the first stages of a
decision or research question. Consistent, regular input can help you break through stagnant
periods, and harness the productive ones

It should be pretty easy. I'm working on a 2to3 metaclass fixer, which
could provide guidance for a 3to2 fixer.

Do we want to take this opportunity to create a real 3to2 project in
the sandbox? If so, I'd like to refactor lib2to3 into its own project,
then import that into 2to3 and 3to2. I can do the work.

Cracking open Apple's ultra-thin MacBook Air



The Apple MacBook Air is thin, light, and a testament to
what good engineering and design can accomplish in a
notebook personal computer. Come along as we reveal how
Apple was able to squeeze substantial computer power into
a very thin space.

There is no paradox if you use probability theory as extended logic to 
analyze the situation.  Let X represent our background information 
(understanding of spatial relationships and U.S. geography), and let's 
analyze the above.

1. ""From p, we can infer q...""

That is, our background information X tells us that (p => q) is true.  
In symbols,

  P(p => q | X) = 1,

and hence P(q | p, X) = 1.

2. ""From q, we can infer r: It is possible that Ronald was born in New 
Jersey.""

That is, P(r1 | q, X) > 0, where r1 is ""Ronald was born in New Jersey"".

3. ""On the other hand, from p we can infer s: It is not possible that 
Ronald was born in New Jersey.""

That is, P(r1 | p, X) = 0.

4. ""We have arrived at a contradiction.""

You have, but we Bayesians have not.  There is no rule in probability 
theory that allows one to conclude P(r1 | p, X) > 0 from P(r1 | q, X) > 
0 and P(q | p, X) = 1.  You appear to be using some form of modus ponens 
in constructing your paradox, but modus ponens doesn't generalize to 
probabilities; the closest we can get is

P(r1 | p, X)
  = { since (p => q) is known to be true }
P(r1 and q | p, X)
  = { product rule }
P(q | p, X) * P(r1 | q, p, X)
  = { since (p => q) is known to be true }
P(r1 | q, p, X)

To get the paradox we would have to conclude P(r1 | q, p, X) > 0 from 
P(r1 | q, X) > 0, but probability theory, quite sensibly, does not allow 
this: it is easy to find cases where new information (p, in this case) 
should turn a possibility into an impossibility.

In a sense, what is happening in the proposed paradox is that important 
context is being dropped; this does not happen with probability theory 
because the product rule ensures that contextual information is retained.

For the buildbots, it would be easy to turn -3 on, though.

And these heat-sinks using the larger sized fans are designed to
take that into account.  The ""dead zone"" doesn't extend forever;
it is almost or entirely gone one ""spindle diameter"" past the
fan blades.

I've stuck with just yast this time and it's going a lot better. Thanks

but right now yast is doing the job.

True, although it could also be done in a .pre file.. Although that might set a
bad precedent that you can stick config options in .pre files..

However, 2) and 3) could be implemented without such a need. Those warnings
could, and probably should, be generated after all the configfiles are parsed. 

But I do see your point that for 1) you want to generate the warning as the
files are read, and for that to happen, the setting needs to be in-place already.

(IU is one of the leaders in the consortium). It's community source software. You can just use it for free if you want, or become a member and then you get support and such as well. The vast majority of IU's classes that use any sort of teaching or collaborative tool use sakai (locally branded as ""Oncourse""). Info on becoming a member is at http://sakaiproject.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=233&Itemid=462 Key item is that an institution can join the Sakai Partners Program for a regular membership: US$10K per year, renewable annually or US$5K per year, renewable annually, for institutions of fewer than 3,000 Fall student enrollment. There are more than 90 universities that are Sakai partners right now. I use it within my group primarily as a collaborative tool (I don't teach). My group depends on it as a mission critical part of its operations. We simply could not function without it. And I think a strong statement of our satisfaction with Sakai is that this situation does not worry me at all!

I think most people who use Ubuntu will agree that the upgrade option
in a lot of cases ends up breaking stuff.  I've found from experience
that if you want to upgrade to a new version of Ubuntu, just backup
your data and do a clean install.

The ""ubuntu forums"" are full of horror stories about using the
""apt-get upgrade distro"" command(s), and it seems to be the same every
time a new version of Ubuntu comes out.

I don't see it like that. I think there are some great answers to some
of the questions being asked, like transparency, campaign practices,
accountability, and  scalable democracy...its just that not enough
folks want to listen to the answers let alone entertain their use as
it would erode a power base, level of comfort, or perish the though
the status quo de jour .

Answers, they are a dime a dozen. We have had editorial columns,
usenets spools, comment sections of blogs, mailing lists and im logs
filled with more answers then not; its action thats the rare item.
Everyone has a reason why not, I got mine you go yours and we all
somehow muddle by for another 4 years until the unsightly zit appears
again and we either cover it up or simply change our world view so
zits are the height of fashion. Mea Culpa, I voted for Kerry last time
with nose held even then knowing I would regret it.

Action, thats the tough nut. How do we, in small and large ways, break
the nightmare cycle we seem to be suck in?

Hey, another question, I bet there is an answer in this list somewhere.

Maybe. But when I install other software in my homedir, I install it to
~/.local, precisely to avoid what Glyph said about getting the full set
of subdirs, and it would be nice for Python to fit into this scheme.

That's not my rule, and it seems that at least Barry and Glyph agree.

Ah... the problem is the *

You're going to have to explicitly list all of the directories
that are on the root partition on the command line, WITHOUT
listing any mountpoints (/home, /usr, whatever)

By using *, you effectively said ""stay within ANY AND ALL of the

Hi,
My set up is
Debian - Etch / php5.2.08/apache2/squirrelmail1.5.1/plugins installed - calendar, squirrelspell, 'html_mail, spam_buttons.
For composing and sending mails through squirrelmail we use exim4 with additional -v argument for verbose output.
Some of our users want Delivery  Receipt, which is not working in squirrelmail 1.5.1, so I am thinking of  redirecting the verbose output  from exim to a file (that with contain all the helo ehelo etc) and  provide that as delivery receipt.
So appreciate if any one can point to the right place to look for redirecting the verbose output from exim while sending mails.

Thanks,
coolprgrmr.

trac supports a pretty wide set of VCSes.

Maybe your tools could integrate these backends somehow instead of
re-implementing yet another suite of VCS backend connectors.

http://www.kent.ac.uk/secl/philosophy/jw/2006/capim.htm

1 December 2006
Darwin Conference Suite, University of Kent, Canterbury, UK


Causal inference is perhaps the most important form of reasoning in the
biomedical sciences, but its foundations are very much up in the air.
Probabilistic and statistical inference is used to help glean causal
relationships from observed data and from experiments, but the relationship
between causality and probability is by no means clear. Causal inferences in
the biomedical sciences operate on the level of population, the individual,
the molecule and the gene, for instance, yet the connections between these
levels are hard to understand and model.

In this small and informal workshop we shall discuss some of the key
questions concerning causality and probability in the biomedical sciences
from an interdisciplinary perspective.

Dear UAI members,

I am looking at the following problem: Given two nodes A and B in a
Bayesian network, identify all nodes and arcs that are on some active
path between A and B. I am not interested in knowing the exact paths,
just the subset of nodes and arcs that are part of some active path. To
avoid delving into this unneccessarily, does anyone have any references
on how to do this efficiently?

Assuming that companies are inherently and inescapably psychopathic by 
their very nature and that they don't do things out of altruism, only 
out of profit - does anybody have any figures for what companies would 
lose by not having patent protection versus what they currently spend on 
lawyers for applying for and defending against patents?

Presumably the issue is that this is skewed and that patents are 
supposed to give a small companies an easy leg up.

    Multimedia Analysis and Uncertainty Representation (MAUR)
                    Half Day Workshop
             http://image.ntua.gr/events/maur/web/


              First International Conference on
    Semantic and Digital Media Technologies (6-8 December 2006)
        Wednesday December 6 2006 – Athens, Greece
                http://samt2006.org/index.html

DESCRIPTION Multimedia processing like analysis and retrieval are
inherently difficult tasks. In order to assist multimedia
processing algorithms and applications, researchers are proposing
ways to enrich multimedia algorithms with knowledge
representational formalisms. In this way the multimedia processing
techniques could take advantage of formal representation and
automated reasoning methods.

On the other hand multimedia processing algorithms are usually
facing a huge amount of uncertain and imprecise knowledge. Hence
knowledge representational formalisms must be equipped with
mechanisms that are able to cope with such type of knowledge.

The last couple of years a quite impressive number of uncertainty
handling formalism have been developed, like fuzzy and
probabilistic Description Logics, fuzzy, possibilistic and
probabilistic Logic Programming languages etc. Such logical
formalisms combine expressive power and decidable reasoning
techniques.

The use of such formalisms in multimedia applications would
greatly benefit these applications and will provide new research
results.

TOPICS
 Multimedia Content Representation and Reasoning.
 Image and Video Analysis with Uncertainty Reasoning.
 Segmentation.
 Recognition.
 Multimedia Information retrieval.
 Scene Interpretation.
 Automatic Annotation.
 Classification and indexing of multimedia information objects.

So, now the byte object behaves equal in 2.6 and 3.0, right?

Untitled Document














RIAs can give your company complete control over how its brand is experienced...
The emergence of Web 2.0 technologies and the iPhone experience have shown that great user interface design makes a big difference. The era of primitive HTML websites is over, and even Fortune 500 companies are wising up to the fact.
								
                   On the Web, the new priority is innovation and optimizing the user experience and the Rich Internet Applications tools and platforms that encourage and support superior user experience are fast becoming an enterprise requirement for business survival and success.

 


AJAXWorld Conference & Expo brings you a chance to get to grips with those platforms and tools. No other RIA-focused conference slices and dices the Web development and application space as boldly or as comprehensively as AJAXWorld 2008 East. For 3 action-packed days across 6 content-rich tracks, from March 18-20, there will be an absolute focus at The Roosevelt Hotel in midtown Manhattan on 15 core topics in sessions and demo presentations by 90+ speakers. 

Don't forget too that the extensive Expo floor additionally will allow you to follow up on the premier RIA solutions already available and to choose which best suits your business and technology needs.





Hope to see you in New York City next month at the 5th International AJAXWorld !

Tim Stoop <mpr.dkine@gmail.com>,zi9rpy-fcecq@lists.sourceforge.net,"Wed, 06 Aug 2008 20:23:24 +0100",[Py2exe-users] unknown url type: 'c',"Hi all,
I'm working on a small little app that incorporates minixsv and some urllib
functions. When I run the app in Windows, it works as expected. However,
once I build an executable with py2exe, I'm getting the error ""unknown url
type: 'c'"" when it tries to download or verify an xml document.

I've spent a few hours now tracing this and all I can find is that that
specific error message seems only to be generated by urllib and urllib2. In
both cases it has something to do with the method urllib.splittype not
finding a correct url type. Since urllib.splittype does:

def splittype(url):
    """"""splittype('type:opaquestring') --> 'type', 'opaquestring'.""""""
    global _typeprog
    if _typeprog is None:
        import re
        _typeprog = re.compile('^([^/:]+):')

    match = _typeprog.match(url)
    if match:
        scheme = match.group(1)
        return scheme.lower(), url[len(scheme) + 1:]
    return None, url

I'm thinking somewhere in the code a certain string gets altered by py2exe
to start with ""c:"" where it shouldn't have been. But I'm at a loss as where
that can be and how I can mitigate that.

My code is GPL, so you can view it here:
http://addup.hokkertjes.nl/addup.zip

I run Python 2.4.4 on the Windows machine.

Any help or tips are appreciated! Please let me know if you need any more
info.

""Dimension reduction in complex models"" by Carlo Laing

Time: 4pm
Date: Thursday, 6 March
Place: Staff Lounge, Study Centre

Many complex systems show relatively simple, effectively low-dimensional
behaviour. I will discuss a method for bypassing an analytical 
derivation of the equations describing this low-dimensional behaviour by 
using appropriately initialised and processed short bursts of simulation 
of the original complex system. Two examples are used: a heterogeneous 
network of coupled oscillators, and a non-local pattern-forming PDE.

Mails are correctly delivered to virtual users through ldap for their main account. Two problems remain: 1) Aliases for a mail address are not working, I got a ""status=bounced (user unknown)"" when I try to send a mail to an alias of a virtual user. If I do a postmap -q ndie@example.com ldap:/etc/postfix/ldap-aliases.cf, I get the mail address of the user: cnrlgqjyu@example.com, so it's ok. I read the query on my ldap log and I well see the lines: Mar  6 09:45:09 portail1 slapd[6074]: conn=326 op=1 SRCH base=""ou=hosting,dc=example,dc=com"" scope=2 deref=0 filter=""(&(objectClass=mailAccount)(kinneqbqw=xfza@example.com )(mailenable=ok))"" Mar  6 09:45:09 portail1 slapd[6074]: conn=326 op=1 SRCH attr=mail Mar  6 09:45:09 portail1 slapd[6074]: <= bdb_equality_candidates: (mailalias) index_param failed (18) Mar  6 09:45:09 portail1 slapd[6074]: <= bdb_equality_candidates: (mailenable) index_param failed (18) Mar  6 09:45:09 portail1 slapd[6074]: conn=326 op=1 SEARCH RESULT tag=101 err=0 nentries=1 text= (I have the errors about index_param failed but I don't think this is the reason why it doesn't work for Postfix.) 2) I wanted to have a local delivery for some users (root, admin, etc) for the domain example.com, through /etc/aliases, these addresses are not present in my ldap. When I try to send a mail to vnga@example.com, I have the error: status=bounced (user unknown). I thought that postfix was reading alias_maps then virtual_mailbox_maps then virtual_alias_maps, this is not the case? My server hostname is portail1.example.com and it hosts virtual domains in a ldap (included example.com). A question: is it possible to have adresses in local and other adresses in ldap for example.com ? For all the domains other than example.com, these one are in LDAP.

That's horrible.  I doubt you give morphine to a five year old who falls and 
scrapes his knee.  This is the equivalent in releasing software.

I can see patching the previous release in case of a critical bugfix, but if 
we get in the habit of encouraging users to expect updates of anything older 
than the previous stable release for free, we've doomed the project.

Point releases every month.  Major releases every three months.  Complete and 
utter refusal to support users who expect that they can install Parrot 1.0 
and get free support from the mailing list or IRC for the next eight to ten 
years.  If we don't set those expectations now, we might avoid the problem of 
these leeches in the future.  (Again, see Perl 5 for an example of why 
maintaining multiple stable branches doesn't work, why encouraging people not 
to upgrade doesn't work, why release candidates don't work, and why 
feature-based releases don't work.)

Agree.

Traditionally, it has been.  If mergebacks are small and frequent, I can live 
with long-lived branches.

The problem isn't that branches live too long.  The problem is that features 
are too big and take too long to develop.  Small, working, isolated steps are 
always better than big thuds.  Branches only seem to protect us from those 
big thuds by keeping trunk stable.  (If you can't keep your branch stable... 
well, there's another problem obvious to anyone who watched the concurrency 
branch.)

My project is to give 2to3 fixers the ability to rank how confident they are on each fix, and let users choose to intervene manually whenever that confidence level is below a certain threshold. Among other things, this might allow fixers for situations where the code translation is not always guaranteed to be correct (like % string formatting, which came up recently in another thread). The full proposal is at http://isnomore.net/2to3 . Collin Winter will be my mentor, and I'd like to thank him and Christian Heimes for all the help they gave me in designing the project. I'd also like to thank Martin Löwis, for discussing a project with me which ended up not turning into a proposal, but helped me write the 2to3 one. Finally, I'd like to request commit privileges to work on a sandbox branch, during the Summer of Code. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.

Special issue of _Information Fusion_ on

Competing Fusion Methods - Real-world Performances

-----

Submission procedures:

http://perception.inrialpes.fr/people/Cuzzolin/files/IFJ-CFP-CFM-Final.pdf

-----

This special issue will consider submissions that report on real-world
experiences in which two or more distinct approaches to the same
information fusion problem have been tested and compared.

There are many competing methods for fusion, for example: Bayesian,
statistical (such as frequentist, Kalman fliters, or Dempster-Shafer),
heuristic (like templates, cluster analysis, or voting systems), or
knowledge-based (such as fuzzy logic, rule-based, or other
representations).

Methods vary among themselves along several dimensions, such as
generality, computational cost, how many and what specific type of
assumptions are required, and whether those assumptions pertain only
to the particular problem at hand.

Further, it often happens that distinct theoretical approaches yield nearly
identical conclusions, or equally plausible different conclusions. It can
also happen that hybrid systems, which combine several approaches,
might outperform systems based solely on any of the purebred approaches
represented in the hybrid. An example of a hybrid could involve a
hierarchical fuser in which some sensors combine by Bayes, other sensors
by Dempster-Shafer, and these two sensor-groups are reconciled
heuristically.

We invite manuscripts that are neither previously published nor presented
anywhere else in a more-or-less similar form. Manuscripts should clearly
present:

• A full description of the real-world information-fusion problem to which
   competing methods were applied
• A description of the methods that were chosen for trial, including what
   specializations of the general methods were needed for the particular
   application (while avoiding tutorial-like presentations of wellknown methods)
• The dimensions of performance studied (such as time requirements,
   reliability of inference, user understanding of results, and the like)
• Additional information that contributed to the analysis (like theoretical
   considerations, or the experiences of others in the literature)
• The methods and results of the testing
• The conclusions drawn, including the choice of method, or combination of
   methods, ultimately fielded, with emphasis on possible new insights on the
   presented approaches gained through comparison.

I run a FreeBSD 5.4-release AMD-64 based server, on which I have installed SA (identified by pkg_info as: ""p5-Mail-SpamAssassin-3.2.4_2"") through Amavisd-new (precise version, according to pkg_info: ""amavisd-new-2.5.2,1""), which is being invoked after mail arrives on the RX side of Sendmail. The RX daemon is split in two, and tunnels the mail locally through amavisd-new (using clamd and SA), and all mail that passes the tests gets delivered, and the rest goes directly to the quarantine.

The problem:
The above set-up was working fine (using SA 3.2.3) for several months, and virtually no spam got through. However, all of a sudden since some two weeks I'm getting about 100 spam mails per day again, and these seem to include spam mails that I have previously seen being filtered out... Still, by far most of the spam does get filtered out, but for some reason (perhaps spammers finding ways around SA?) more and more spam is getting through again.

My approach so far:
Figuring SA or the rules to be outdated (despite the twice-weekly call to sa-update from cron), I first updated SA to 3.2.4. (and performed an sa-update too), but to no real avail: the same amount of spam seemed to be getting through. I then checked into additional channels, and soon came across the SARE (based) ones. I decided to add the saupdates.openprotect.com channel, but still the same amount of spam seems to get through.

The way I perform my updates are as follows:

Cron call:
23 3 * * 2,5 /usr/local/bin/sa-update --allowplugins --gpgkeyfile /root/sa_pgp_keys --channelfile /root/sa_channels && /usr/local/etc/rc.d/sa-spamd.sh restart > /dev/null

(yes, I realise spamd is not actually used by amavisd-new, but I decided to have it running anyway)

My /root/sa_channels file contains the following:
saupdates.openprotect.com
updates.spamassassin.org

Now, my questions are:
1-Am I doing anything wrong, or am I grossly overlooking something?
2-I've never tried to teach SA about which messages are spam and which are ham. From what I gather from the website, I need to set-up a mailbox with solely spam and feed that to sa-learn, and then do the same for a mailbox containing solely ham. However, how can I best go about this? Once spam is misidentified, it gets mixed in the live mailboxes with ham, so I wouldn't want to classify all of it as either ham or spam... Then, I did keep the spam messages from the last few days. Can I perhaps (manually) forward those to a local mailbox, and then run sa-learn on that mailbox, getting it successfully identified as spam, or will that not work due to the new mail headers added by the forward action from my mail client?
3-Are there perhaps other good (preferrably automatic ways) to tell SA about what is spam, and what isn't?
4-Are there perhaps other very efficient rules channels that you can recommend me to add (like using the full set of SARE rules, rather than the openprotect subset of it)?
5-Just a theory, but is it perhaps possible that SA somehow misidentified a spam message as being ham, and that all messages that are similar to that particular spam message are now being misidentified as ham, hence all getting through?

Any and all feedback will be greatly appreciated, and I would like to thank you all for taking the time to read this e-mail and address the questions raised in it.

With kind regards,

I think there is a way to mark the failing ones as todo tests, youd
have to poke around in the re_tests test file to see how, if not just
modify regexp.t to do it somehow. Probably its just as simple as
saying 'TODO' on the test name, if not, well thats how i would do it.

Im hoping to find some perl related tuits soon.

Right. We've done this 2-stage rename before, during the great
(sometimes known as grand) renaming, in the 1.x days.

Clearly a number like 805468008 can't be right. In fact, trying to do something like:  @x = @-;  causes an Out of Memory error (because it's trying to allocate an array with 805468008+1 elements in it.   To answer your question, when $#+ is 0, $#- should also be 0.  And it normally is.  If you fiddle around with the program I sent by deleting the irrelevant lines, for example, you will see when you test it that it will print out  <0><0>  in almost all cases.   But for some strange reason I don't understand there are some cases where $#- has a value from some random memory location (I think) and goes bonkers. I hope that helps.

Dear Auckland staff members

You are invited to attend a Moving and Handling course.

Would you like to know how to avoid muscular stress and strain? Have you
ever pulled a muscle reaching for something? Do you suffer from back
discomfort after a long day at work? If your answer is ""Yes"" to any of

of your body; how to move to reduce strain in your neck and back;
improve manual handling techniques and prevent the onset of injury. It
looks at sitting and standing, and your dynamic posture as well as your
shoulder, arm and hand function.  This course provides useful
information for all staff, whether you are lecturing, involved in
lifting and handling loads, or spend most of your time working at a
computer.

Date:  Thursday 27 March 2008
Time:	 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
Venue: AT1

The Income University System is virtually 100% automated, you can work as
little as an
hour per day and make thousands of dollars a week.

I made more than $1800 on one day and it only took me just 1 hour of work
to achieve this result. 
I can reproduce similar results every day and make more than $5000 per week
since I discovered & 
improved my method - proof:

Nothing is guaranteed, of course.  Some stable releases have contained
bugs.  But generally, the SVN repo for our stable branch will usually
be better than the last stable release because it contains fixes for
any bugs in the previous releases.

That never happens in our stable branch.  Only a select number of new
features are added, and they are always checked in in full.

The best thing to do in a serious production environment is test it in
a parallel installation on your own servers to guarantee its
stability.  We have not discussed a 1.4.14 release yet, but it IS more
stable than 1.4.13 already because it has a couple small but important
fixes for some compose bugs.

I want to run a program within a bash script, essentially daemonize a 
program that doesn't have a daemon mode.

#!/bin/sh

echo ""What Is Your Passsword: ""
stty_orig=`stty -g`
stty -echo
read -r PASSWORD
stty $stty_orig

TIMEOUT=600

while [ 1 ]
do
	echo $PASSWORD | program
	sleep $TIMEOUT
done

not my code, someone elses program, I can modify it, but that's a pain, 
was mostly wondering if it could be changed at the python level (or at 
least understand why python made the decision it did, sort of understand 
the eating stdin aspect)

Article 9.1:
         Notice of a proposal to seek an amendment to this constitution
shall be given to members at least four working days prior to the meeting at
which such proposal shall be considered. Such a proposal must receive the
approval of two thirds of the members present at such meeting.

Although I am of the opinion that the Constitution should serve the group,
and not vice versa, it's hard to escape the conclusion that the current
committee was elected in contravention of the Constitution.

IMO, the issue is more of ""is the corpus clean and it's really a spam"", and ""is
there a bug which that message tickled which caused the FP"".  a single FP is
generally not a huge deal.

               SIGIR'07 Workshop: IRGM 2007

Information Retrieval and Applications of Graphical Models
                http://irgm.bpiwowar.net
-----------------------------------------------------------

MOTIVATION:

Probabilistic models constitute an important kind of Information 
Retrieval (IR) model. They have been long and widely used, and offer a 
principled way of managing the uncertainty that naturally appears in 
many elements within this field. Nowadays, the dominant approach for 
managing probability within the field of Artificial Intelligence is 
based on the use of Bayesian Networks, and these have also been used 
within IR as extensions of classical probabilistic models.

Broadly speaking, a Graphical Model (GM)  consists of a qualitative 
part, a graph,  which may be directed and acyclic in the case of 
Bayesian Networks (BN), and a quantitative one, a collection of 
numerical parameters, as the conditional probability tables for BNs or 
possibility distributions for possibilistic networks. The knowledge 
represented in the graphical component is expressed in terms of 
dependence and independence relationships between variables. These 
relationships are encoded by means of the presence or absence of links 
between nodes in the graph. The knowledge represented in the numerical 
part quantifies the dependences encoded in the graph, and allows us to 
introduce uncertainty into the model.

Therefore, these tools could be very appropriate to model and solve 
problems, as those found in the IR field.

GOAL:

As the main goal, this workshop wants to be a common space where 
researchers, in general, and young researchers specifically, can show 
their innovative GMs applications to the field of IR, in its wide 
problem space, opening a new discussion forum. Graphical Models include 
Bayesian Networks, possibilistic networks, Markov networks, dependence 
graphs,  influence diagrams,  probability trees, decision trees, and 
Fisher Kernel Discriminants, among others.

TOPICS OF INTEREST:

The scope of this workshop will be all the applications of any type of 
GMs to IR problems. Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

- Information Retrieval Models for flat or structured document 
collections (based on SGML, XML, etc.).
- Cross-language retrieval.
- Web  Information Retrieval / Applications to hypertext.
- Indexing and summarization.
- Multimedia information access, as video, audio or  image retrieval.
- Document filtering. Recommender Systems: content-based and collaborative.
- Question answering and extraction.
- Text data mining and machine learning for IR.
- Document classification and clustering  (for flat or structured 
documents).
- Any other relevant IR topic.

Theoretical or experimental research papers representing original, 
previously unpublished works, are invited to be submitted to the 
workshop, not exceeding 8 pages. Positioning papers  describing current 
research are also welcome, as well as opinion papers discussing GMs in 
an IR context. Paper should emphasize the strengths (and weaknesses) of 
the GMs to solve an IR problem, especially with respect to other 
methods. Contributions will be peer-reviewed by two experts from the 
related field belonging to the workshop PC and accepted papers will be 
included in printed proceedings.

IMPORTANT DATES:

- Deadline for paper submission: May 31th 2007.
- Acceptance / rejection notification: June 19th 2007.
- Deadline for camera ready submission: July 1st 2007.
- Workshop: Amsterdam, July 27th 2007.

Are we going to want to keep the ""u"" variants of the gettext APIs

I don't see how we could remove them in 3.0, but perhaps rename then

Presumably, this happened in connection with the server move in early 
July. Mail-invoked interfaces are such a pain -- if the program gets 
disabled for whatever reason, reports just pile up in the ""R-bugs""

I see three levels of thread interruption. First, you might want to
poke a thread just to wake up a single system call, but the thread
might get back to work afterwards. This resembles Java's
Thread.interrupt. Second, you might want to cancel the thread, but
only in ways that let the user clean up afterward. This is vaguely
like pthread_cancel, or like Thread.interrupt with no way to clear the
interrupted status. Third, you might want to really abort the thread,
like Java's Thread.stop.

There are uses for all three levels, but for a first implementation, I
think we should pick just one. Because aborting is unsafe in most
situations, it's out. And I vaguely remember Josh Block saying that if
he had to do Java over again, he'd make it impossible to clear a
Thread's interrupted status, turning it into cancellation, but I need
to check with him to make sure I got that right.

I'm not opposed in theory to providing the really violent option in,
say, the version after we provide plain cooperative cancellation, but:
 1) Any given library can simulate it by calling
threading.cancellation_point() (or whatever its name turns out to be)
occasionally within its inner loop, and
 2) Judging from other systems with violent interruptions like posix
signals and Haskell asynchronous exceptions, we'll need a way of
blocking aborts in a scope, and unblocking them in a sub-scope.

 	ICML07 Second Call for Workshop Proposals

Your help with circulating this announcement locally is much
appreciated. Apologies for multiple postings.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The ICML-2007 Organizing Committee invites proposals for workshops to
be held at the 24th International Conference on Machine Learning
(ICML-2007), on Sunday, June 24, 2007 at Oregon State University,
Corvallis, Oregon, U.S.A.

Workshops provide organizers and participants with an opportunity to
focus intensively on a specific topic in machine learning or a closely
related area. Workshops can choose to concentrate on emerging research
topics, but can also be devoted to application issues, or to questions
concerning the economic and social aspects of machine learning and
data mining. Successful proposals should propose topics of importance
that will draw a reasonably large set of participants from the machine
learning, and possibly other, communities.

Proposal Due Date: February 16 2007
Acceptance notification: February 23 2007

Guidelines for writing and submitting a proposal can be found at
http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~afern/icml07/workshops.html

The critical parts of the design and implementation are basically
done.  I've implemented monitors to contain objects without an
explicit thread-safe API, which then let me remove the GIL.  I've
created a synchronous/asynchronous refcounting scheme that reuses our
existing INCREF/DECREF API, but also minimizes contention when used by
more than one thread.  The net result is that although there's a
significant amount of overhead, I can demonstrate scalability to more
than one thread (I've only been able to test with two cores though.)

I've replaced __del__ API (which resurrected objects) with a
__finalize__/__finalizeattrs__ API (which doesn't).  Attributes listed
in __finalizeattrs__ are proxied into a core object, a finalizer
thread is given a reference to the core, and when the main object is
deleted the GC asynchronously notifies the finalizer thread so that it
can call core.__finalize__().  The net result is an API very similar
to __del__ (you need to list attributes it might use), but it's now
impossible for the GC to run arbitrary code (I even enforce this).

Missing there is generator cleanup.  I don't allow the GC to run a
generator long enough to raise GeneratorExit, so an alternative will
be needed.

I'm currently working on flushing out the design.  I recently rewrote
and reenabled the tracing GC, next up is the automatic deadlock
detection/breaking.

As for merging back into CPython, I could build smaller patches, but
the design can't be completely separated.  For example, __finalize__
is called from another thread, so Monitor's @monitormethod should be
applied.  I don't specifically require Monitor, just that the object
(and therefor its methods) be shareable, and Monitor is the easiest
way to provide that.

I say keep the runtime warning. 2to3 can't fix the cases where the
module is being removed entirely; the best it can do is to flag the
import statement as requiring the user's attention.

Tom Wyant <veyjhby-fbuaeanj@perl.org>,ozip-dhyivplsb@netlabs.develooper.com,"Wed, 06 Aug 2008 22:40:57 -0700","[perl #47015] ""v-string in use/require non-portable"" not in perldelta ","# New Ticket Created by  Tom Wyant 
# Please include the string:  [perl #47015]
# in the subject line of all future correspondence about this issue. 
# 


This is a bug report for perl from abk@wyants-white-imac.local,
generated with the help of perlbug 1.36 running under perl 5.10.0.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
The new ""use VERSION"" diagnostic
    v-string in use/require is non-portable
is not mentioned in the perldelta for 5.10.0. I do not know whether
this is an oversight or an editorial decision not to clutter perldelta
with trivialities. If the former, I hoped to be of service by catching
it, but if the latter I do not intend to quibble.

There are some other ""use VERSION""-related diagnostics that appear in
the 5.10.0 perldiag but not the 5.8.8 perldiag, but I have been unable
to determine whether they are genuinely new or simply omitted from the
5.8.8 perldiag:
    Invalid version format (multiple underscores)
    Invalid version format (underscores before decimal)
    Version string '%s' contains invalid data; ignoring: '%s'

Lastly, it seems to me that the description of ""v-string in use/require
is non-portable"" is somewhat confusing. On first reading it seems to say
to use floating point version numbers for backward portability, and then
to say that this does not help. Instead of
    
    If you want your scripts to be backward portable, use the floating
    point version number: for example, instead of ""use 5.6.1"" say ""use
    5.006_001"".  This of course won't help: the older Perls won't
    suddenly start understanding newer features, but at least they will
    show a sensible error message indicating the required minimum
    version.
    
something like

    If you want your scripts to be backward portable, use the floating
    point version number: for example, instead of ""use 5.6.1"" say ""use
    5.006_001"".  This of course won't make older Perls suddenly start
    understanding newer features, but at least they will show a sensible
    error message indicating the required minimum version.

might be clearer, if this is indeed the intended meaning.

This last point borders on a spelling/grammar flame. It is not so
intended, which is why it is tacked somewhat apologetically on the end,
rather than submitted separately. Again, please apply your editorial
judgement.

I don't think you can get general agreement on which tend to connote
numerical indicies more.  On the other hand, in many contexts ""index""
is a general concept, while ""subscript"" is a typographical convention
for representing an index.

+1 on indexable
+0.5 on subscriptable
-0.1 on scriptable

If you can mind the overhead, the ClamAV plugin with Sane Security

Targeted Job Fairs, a Dice Company, produces Dice's technology, engineering and security clearance career fairs.

Why attend a career fair?
Attending a career fair is a great way to bolster your job-seeking efforts. Most prospective employees stick with the traditional methods of finding a job  by answering ads posted in the newspaper or on an online job board. By attending career fairs, you are putting yourself directly in front of the companies that need your skills, giving yourself a leg up on the competition. 

What can I expect?
You can expect to meet with recruiters from hiring companies in your community and nationally. The event is designed for candidates to have informative face-to-face discussions with each recruiter. 

Who is Targeted Job Fairs?
Targeted Job Fairs (TJF), a Dice company, is the premier producer of career fairs catering to technology, engineering and security-cleared professionals. TJF also assists recruiters and hiring managers by helping them meet face-to-face with hard-to-find technology, engineering and security-cleared professionals. TJF also produces diversity events and individual open houses in several markets for companies seeking experienced candidates in a variety of industries such as sales, marketing, banking, insurance and finance. 

With more than 90 events held every year, TJF targets the top national markets to find the best candidates. As a leading career fair company for more than 12 years, TJF is a one-stop, full-service solution for planning, coordinating, promoting and implementing successful career fairs. 

TJF's association with Dice  the nations leading online job board for IT professionals   provides companies and recruiters access to 1.7 million technology and engineering professionals. And, because of its association with ClearanceJobs.com, also a Dice company, TJF has access to 90,000 security-cleared professionals. These connections help TJF hand-deliver high-quality technology, engineering and security-cleared candidates to each TJF event.

Massimiliano,

The correct answer is this on our systems

setuidgid clamav /var/qmail/bin/qmail-scanner-queue.pl -z
setuidgid clamav /var/qmail/bin/qmail-scanner-queue.pl -g

be careful though, about the user you use... we use clamav user

when you are done and if I recall correctly, you should stop and restart all
necessary services to pull in the new config info so to speak.

The no hits part, I dunno. Could be to large message or whatever else... you
can debug that in the logs

since myorigin=$mydomain, this simply says:

y.selbaxdqxmf@domain.gr a.faragitakis@domain.gr

but postfix has no idea how to deliver to a.faragitakis@domain.gr. 

Thus the error:

           Summary: Problem with The But cut messages
           Product: Spamassassin
           Version: 3.1.0
          Platform: PC
        OS/Version: FreeBSD
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
          Priority: P5
         Component: spamassassin
        AssignedTo: xrh@spamassassin.apache.org
        ReportedBy: wdavhpmqbngb@yandex.ru


I use spamassassin + axigen mail server. All is fine, but I noticed that  the 
error ""Filtering process timed out"" appears when the Bat cuts the letter with 
big attachments into the number of messages... In this case the recipient gets 
only the first part of the message... other parts stop in the queue with 
error ""Fail-info: Filter SpamAssassin Filter:[ERROR]: Filtering process timed 
out Status:PROCESSING ERROR"". I tested it a few times.

The Axigen Mail Support said: 
----
The processing timeout given by the spamassassin software cannot be
escaped unfortunately. It is caused by spamassassin while it waits for
the message to be formatted in a specific way, although it is not.

We have notified the spamassassin team about this matter, but until this
time, no solution has been provided. As such, messages such as the
logwatch cron message, will be stuck in the queue until dropped.

Please, tell me what to do.. is it a bug of spamassassin?

Thank you!
Alexander

btw, I disagree on this point.  If the real headers look like

  Header1: value1
  Header2: value2

then get(""ALL"") should not return

  Header1:  value1
  Header2:  value2

with *additional* spaces added.  I can see marginal utility in ""simplifying""
long strings of whitespace down to a single space -- but adding spaces where
they aren't in the original string, IMO, is a bug.

rcoder <mpdotbook@gmail.com>,r-help@r-project.org,"Wed, 06 Aug 2008 13:12:35 -0700",[R]  using acf() for multiple columns,"
Hi everyone,

I'm trying to use the acf() function to calculate the autocorrelation of
each column in a matrix. The trouble is that I can only seem to get the
function to work if I extract the data in the column into a separate matrix
and then apply the acf() function to this column.

I have something like this: acf(mat,lag.max=10,na.action=na.pass)

.but I would really like to apply the function to 'mat' where 'mat' is a
matrix as opposed to a vector. The function actually doesn't return an acf
coefficient, but instead plots the data. So, in addition to handling
matrices with multiple columns, would anyone know how to coerce the function
to output the underlying data?

Finally, when working with a matrix, is there a way I can specify how many
plots I can display after the function executes? I managed to generate a
multiple plot when I was experimenting, but the titles suggested the acf was
calculated between adjacent columns in the matrix, which is something I was
puzzled about.

Thanks,

rcoder

Daryl, maybe it's just too late for me today, and I missed it. Where's the
actual rule? The name doesn't suggest to me it checks the first two IPs for
equality, does it?

If I get some time the next days, I'll check my recent corpus for this. Maybe I
should set up a mass-check env one of these days...

AFAIK, that option is used only at boot time: Did you make sure there 
actually are files that have not been accessed for a week? Try ls -lu.

Moreover, there is another variable, OWNER_TO_KEEP_IN_TMP. Files 
belonging to users in that list are exempt from deletion.

Are there certain versions of version.pm out in the wild that will

jjjanse <szuosso@home.nl>,kpitck-aew45@python.org,"Wed, 06 Aug 2008 11:09:23 +0100",[python-win32] setting labels in outlook calendar,"After googling for a few hours I cannot find a solution to set a color on
outlook appointments.

 

In the following excerpt, an appointment is written, found and all
appointments are read back.

 

I used the makepy utility on the ""Microsoft Outlook 11.0 Object Library"" to
be able to browse

through this object lib and try things out. 

This caused the -well known-? problem of early binding where python
constructions like

 

for afspraak in afspraken:

    start = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp (int (afspraak.Start))   

    subject = afspraak.Subject.encode(""utf-8"")

    print start, subject

 

used to work fine, suddenly were not recognized anymore and had to be
replaced by constructions

like stated below with GetFirst() and GetNext().

 

 

from win32com.client import constants

import win32com.client

import time

import datetime

 

print ('Writing a new appointment')

appointment = outlook.CreateItem(constants.olAppointmentItem)

appointment.Start = '2008-03-10 07:00:00'

appointment.Subject = 'Generated by Python'

appointment.Duration = 15

appointment.Location = 'perron 13a'

appointment.Save()

 

#finding this appointment

afspraken = namespace.GetDefaultFolder(9).Items

aap = afspraken.Find(u""[Subject] = Generated by Python"")

print aap.Subject.encode(""utf-8"")

 

#reading all appointments

afspraken = namespace.GetDefaultFolder(9).Items

afspraken.Sort(""[Start]"") 

afspraken.IncludeRecurrences = ""True""

#Possible columns are Subject, Location, Start, End, Recurrence Pattern,
Categories

afspraak = afspraken.GetFirst()

while afspraak:

    start = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp (int (afspraak.Start))   

    subject = afspraak.Subject.encode(""utf-8"")

    if start == datetime.datetime(2008,03,10, 7,0):

        subject = afspraak.Subject.encode(""utf-8"")

        print subject

    afspraak = afspraken.GetNext()

    if start.year >nextYear:

        #avoid to loop until 2038 :-)

        break

 

So far, so good. But I could only find a VBA example for setting the label
on an appointment

by using a reference to a 'CDO 1.21' library which is not present on my
computer. Furthermore

I had a problem translating this example to python.

 

If u know a solution or example, please let me know,

Thnx in advance,

 

Joost Janse

Thanks!
It works fine, but I tried to make a addition to it, and for some reason it won't ""bite"" on that..

I added this;
body NICE_GIRL_06 /Email me at [^\\s]{,74} only, because I am using my friend\\'s email to write this\\./

to hopefully catch messages like this one:
Hello! I am bored tonight. I am nice girl that would like to chat with you. Email me at dixapqi@TheHealCare.info only, because I am using my friend's email to write this. I want to show you some pictures

However, only your rules 1 and 2 hits, not my addition... Any ideas please?

Anders.

My point was that Python 3000's Resources knob has settings higher than 1.5, 
which is sadly where the Perl 6 and Perl 5 knobs have been stuck, combined, 
for several years now.

If I count correctly, the only person actually spending any day-job time 
working on Perl 5 or 6 with any official blessing from an employer is Jan.  
Maybe Rafael.

That is not the sole cause of problems with the Perl development process, but 
it's a severe disadvantage.  Even Tcl has a full-time developer.

Summary: Junk E-Mail & Action Button

Initial Comment:
First off, this is one of the best programs for Anti-
SPAM I've seen.  Kudos to all...

When in Junk E-Mail the available Button is [Recover 
from Spam] which I've clicked I really meant to DELETE 
them from Junk E-Mail Folder.  (Done this several 
times and may be due to contantly using the [Delete As 
Spam] while in Inbox.)

Could there be a warning that I'm restoring junk 
emails into Inbox or add a [Delete Junk] along with 
[Recover...].

Just though I mention it.

Thanks for all your work...

perhaps that could be a spambayes OPTION to display a popup warning or not
for that action?

This sounds terrible to me.  I would hate to have a
confirmation dialog pop up every time that I used the ""Not
Spam"" button to correct any mistakes.

In the short term choosing ""Blank"" screen as your screen saver may help. 
I have had this issue as well on an ATI card, so it isn't just nVidia

No, but they do warrant updater testing, and I'm pretty sure I've seen an 
update channel with some test updates.

I know there were some for 10.3 when that was in alpha/beta

Presumably, one wants to run one instance per core or per processor (or 
per core per multi-core processor) to fully saturate the processing 
capacity of your system.

Now if there was an easy and efficient way to find out whether 
numification is *not* overloaded on an object, you wouldn't have to 
go through the whole rigamerole of reblessing, but simply return 0 + 
$_[0], no?

Is there an easy and efficient way to check this?

I'd suggest mailing TG4 in regard to this, if you want Linux support.
They don't view Linux support for this as important, and won't deem
it so unless they hear complaints.

They look at their stats I'm sure, and see a low percent of Linux users
compared to Windows, so they don't deem support for Linux as a
necessity.

               8th International Conference on Logic Programming
                       and Nonmonotonic Reasoning
                                 (LPNMR'05)
 
                         Diamante, Cosenza, Italy

                      http://www.mat.unical.it/lpnmr05/


LPNMR'05 is the eighth in the series of international meetings on logic
programming and nonmonotonic reasoning. Seven previous meetings were held
in Washington, D.C., (1991), in Lisbon, Portugal (1993), in Lexington,
Kentucky (1995), in Dagstuhl, Germany (1997), in El Paso, Texas (1999),
in Vienna, Austria (2001), and in Fort Lauderdale, Florida (2004).

LPNMR'05 will be organized by the Department of Mathematics of University
of Calabria (Italy), and will be co-located with the INFOMIX Workshop
on Data Integration.

AIMS AND SCOPE
--------------

LPNMR is a forum for exchanging ideas on declarative logic programming, 
nonmonotonic reasoning and knowledge representation. The aim of the conference 
is to facilitate interactions between researchers interested in the design 
and implementation of logic based programming languages  and database systems, 
and researchers who work in the areas of knowledge  representation and 
nonmonotonic reasoning. LPNMR strives to encompass these theoretical and 
exprimental studies  that lead to the construction of practical systems 
for declarative  programming and knowledge representation. 

Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original and unpublished 
research on nonmonotonic aspects of logic programming and knowledge 
representation. We particularly encourage papers on application of LPNMR 
techniques to build significant applications.

A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest includes: 

1. Development and mathematical studies of logical systems
   with nonmonotonic entailment relations:
     - Semantics of new and existing languages;
     - Relationships between formalisms;
     - Complexity and expressive power;
     - Development of inference algorithms and search heuristics for
       LPNMR systems;
     - Extensions of ''classical'' LPNMR languages by new logical
       connectives and new inference capabilities such as abduction,
       reasoning by cases, etc;
     - Updates and other operations on LPNMR systems;
     - Uncertainty in LPNMR systems.
 
2. Implementation of LPNMR systems: 
     -  system descriptions, comparisons, evaluations;
     -  LPNMR benchmarks.

3. Applications of LPNMR systems:
     - LPNMR languages and algorithms in planning, diagnosis,
       software engineering, decision making, and other domains;
     - Applications of LPNMR languages in Data Integration and Exchange 
       systems;
     - Methodology of representing knowledge in LPNMR languages:
       theory and practice;
     - Integration of LPNMR systems with other computational
       paradigms;
     - Embedded LPNMR systems: Systems using LPNMR subsystems.          


SYSTEM AND APPLICATION DEMONSTRATION TRACKS
-------------------------------------------

As part of the technical program, we also plan a special session devoted 
to presentations and demonstrations of implemented nonmonotonic reasoning 
systems. Systems and application demonstration tracks will be announced 
in a distinct call.

What do you think that ""return \\%data{@keys}"" means? It pretty much
looks to me like the user wants to return a reference to a hash slice.
To make it sort of work, you could write it like I show below, but that
involves copying, which might not be what the user wanted:

    my %tmp;
    @tmp{@keys} = @data{@keys};
    return \\%tmp;

As Oleg mentioned, if the method is called something like  
'guess_encoding', I think we could live with clear consciences.

IMO, encoding estimation is something that many web programs will  
have to deal with, so it might as well be built in; I would prefer  
the option to run `text=input.encode('guess')` (or something similar)  
than relying on an external dependency or worse yet using a hand- 
rolled algorithm.

    Following on from the success of previous sprint/bugfix weekends and
    sprinting efforts at PyCon 2008, I'd like to propose the next two
    Global Python Sprint Weekends take place on the following dates:

        * May 10th-11th (four days after 2.6a3 and 3.0a5 are released)
        * June 21st-22nd (~week before 2.6b2 and 3.0b2 are released)

    It seems there are a few of the Python User Groups keen on meeting
    up in person and sprinting collaboratively, akin to PyCon, which I
    highly recommend.  I'd like to nominate Saturday across the board
    as the day for PUGs to meet up in person, with Sunday geared more
    towards an online collaboration day via IRC, where we can take care
    of all the little things that got in our way of coding on Saturday
    (like finalising/preparing/reviewing patches, updating tracker and
    documentation, writing tests ;-).

    For User Groups that are planning on meeting up to collaborate,
    please reply to this thread on zvllln-eum@python.org and let every-
    one know your intentions!

    As is commonly the case, #python-dev on irc.freenode.net will be
    the place to be over the course of each sprint weekend; a large
    proportion of Python developers with commit access will be present,
    increasing the amount of eyes available to review and apply patches.

    For those that have an idea on areas they'd like to sprint on and
    want to look for other developers to rope in (or just to communicate
    plans in advance), please also feel free to jump on this thread via
    python-dev@ and indicate your intentions.

    For those that haven't the foggiest on what to work on, but would
    like to contribute, the bugs tracker at http://bugs.python.org is
    the best place to start.  Register an account and start searching
    for issues that you'd be able to lend a hand with.

    All contributors that submit code patches or documentation updates
    will typically get listed in Misc/ACKS.txt; come September when the
    final release of 2.6 and 3.0 come about, you'll be able to point at
    the tarball or .msi and exclaim loudly ``I helped build that!'',
    and actually back it up with hard evidence ;-)

    Bring on the pizza and Red Bull!

        Trent.

Are the serial ports on your AMD 64X2 actually enabled in the BIOS?  
""Incorrect function"" usually means that the system sent a request into 
the serial driver, and the particular request it sent is not one that 
the driver supports.  If the serial ports were disabled in the BIOS (and 
many machines are so configured these days), or if you had a serial 
mouse in that port (which almost no one has any more), or if you were 
talking to a USB-to-serial converter, this kind of thing can happen.

| ever is a very strong word and I expect Python 3.x to follow the rule.

I was tempted to suggest that 'ever' could be interpred as 'ever in 2.x' 
but then I remembered the purpose of the rule, which is to allow a 
forward-looking individual to write modules that will operate in both a 
current version and an anticipated future version *without having to touch 
the code* -- until they choose to for purposes other than deleting future 
statements.  So each version should have a dict of retired futures that are 
accepted and then ignored.

In the case of 2.6 and 3.0, the future version will already be present, so 
it will be easier to develop a nearly complete set of future statements. 
If people who are skittish about autoconversion, especially by someone 
else's code, choose and succeed in writing code in a Python subset that 
works in both 3.0 and futurized 2.6, more power to them.  I do not think 
that they should be impeded by having to delete future statements, now more 
than at any other time.

It would be really nice if we could maintain two parallel Windows 
versions, one with an open source tool chain like Mingw and one with the 
latest and greatest MS production line. Unfortunately the problem seems 
to be developer effort. For a long time only Martin and Tim were serious 
about the Windows platform, and I can appreciate (some of) the extra 
effort that parallel development platforms would require.

Of course, we non-native speakers are completely ignorant of
""reads right"" (even to the extend of spelling that ""reads write""),
and are thus unable to propose anything that sounds ""natural"".

To us, it's all foreign, and identifiers just mean something with
respect to the programming language, but not in real life. So

  with property as x:

is not any better or worse than

  for attribute named bar:

except that we can see how the latter can't work in the Python
syntax as-is.

Regards,
Martin

+1

Why not also make unicode() the default type constructor and only
keep str() as alias to simplify porting (perhaps with a warning) ?

The term ""string"" is just too overloaded with all kinds of
misinterpretations. The term ""string"" just refers to a string of
bytes - a variable length array so to speak. However, depending
on the application space, ""string"" is used as synonym for
""text string"" just as well as ""data string"".

Removing the term ""string"" altogether would make it easier for
people to understand that Py3k only has unicode (for text data)
and bytes (for binary data).

Robert Dodier <zqdjbl.unofid@gmail.com>,faq@engr.orst.edu,"Fri, 08 Aug 2008 01:29:25 -0700",[UAI] seeking recommendations for introductory decision analysis,"Hello,

I have been asked to make recommendations for books or other
resources for an introduction to decision analysis.
I am familiar with ""Making Hard Decisions"" by Robert Clemen,
and I think it is a good introduction because the technical level
is low and emphasis is on concepts. Would anyone like to
recommend other books, papers, web sites, etc ?

Thanks for your help, & all the best.

Robert Dodier

 After updating py3k trunk to the most recent svn version
(62349) and building Python, I am getting the following
error while trying to start the interpreter.

[jkmpq@localhost ~]$ /usr/local/bin/python
Fatal Python error: Py_Initialize: can't initialize sys standard streams
Traceback (most recent call last):

    bytes_warning = sys.flags.bytes_warning
AttributeError: 'sys.flags' object has no attribute 'bytes_warning'
Aborted

I am running Fedora Core 6, with kernel 2.6.22.7-57.fc6 on
an Intel i686 SMP box.  Python was compiled with gcc
version 4.1.2 (Redhat - 4.1.2-13). Python was built with
no additional ./configure flags .

Thanks

make sure it is really used. use this instead:

`logger ""-t maildrop -p mail.info maildroprc used: DEFAULT=$DEFAULT""`
TO ""$DEFAULT/""

is there any .mailfilter in /var/spool/virtual_mailboxes or in the

Where does maildrop (authdaemon) get the mailbox location? what backend 
do you use in authdaemon?

I've looked at os.stat but

os.stat(r'C:\\temp')[os.path.stat.ST_SIZE]

It's really a shame that windows doesn't have a built-in tool to show you a
tree of subdirectories, and how much space is occupied by each subdirectory.

I guess I need to roll my own- once I know what the underlying call is to
get the size of each directory

settings now.

Also I am mounting some shares via fstab with the options rw,intr,hard as we
need the full listing available, which in autofs is mounted only when you cd
to a directory.

The issue we notice here is if the nfs service is restarted, the clients
hang.
In theory I presume the client shout keep on trying to reach nfs and
establish connection once its up again. Or are the settings rw,intr,hard not
appropriate?

Does your modem connect via USB or Ethernet? Given that your'e trying  
to run some nasty Java program, I'm betting it's USB. You'll have a  
MUCH easier life with an Ethernet connection to the modem. This link

Hmmm, so what you're really worried about is that
people will be able to create static methods without
using staticmethod().

I think the solution to this has already been
mentioned. If you're wrapping a method in something
that inserts an extra argument at the beginning,
then you write it as

   @somewrapper
   def meth(extra_arg, self, arg1, arg2, ...)
     ...

Simple, explicit, non-magical, no introspection
required.

Neural Information Processing Systems -- Natural and Synthetic NIPS 2006
Conference -- December 3 - 6, 2007 Hyatt Regency Vancouver, BC, CANADA

www.nips.cc

Demonstration Proposal Deadline: September 21, 2007

Would you like to interactively demonstrate your novel hardware, software,
or wetware technology, your robot, or your chip to people at the NIPS 2007
Conference?

The Neural Information Processing Systems Conference has a Demonstration
Track that will run in parallel with the popular evening Poster Sessions.

Demonstrators will have a chance to show their live interactive demos in the
areas of hardware technology, neuromorphic and biologically-inspired
systems, robotics, and software systems. The only hard rules are that the
demo must show novel technology and must be LIVE and INTERACTIVE!
(It is not a back-door Poster Session.)

The full call for demonstrations is at the following URL:

As a general statement, this is wrong.  Mark gave examples.
Please drop the proposal.

The reason for the int division change is the idea that expressions 
involving integral values should, insofar as possible, have the same value 
result regardless of the types used to carry the input (or output) values. 
Hence 1/2 should equal 1.0/2.0 == .5.  The idea that 1 == 1 and 1.0 == 1.0 
should give a different answer goes against this principle and the 2.x 
project of number unification.

The test duplication issue has been discussed and needs to be
addressed as an overall problem. But in this specific case this sounds
fine to me.

ok_languages and ok_locales are two different settings, both work.
Maybe you just don't have TextCat plugin enabled??

3rd international workshop on

KNOWLEDGE and REASONING for ANSWERING QUESTIONS (KRAQ'07)

Special focus on knowledge explicitation, explanation, and argumentation in 
responses.

Hyderabad, January 6th, 2007


** NEW SUBMISSION DEADLINE !! 25 September 2006**

Deadlines:
September 25: paper submissions
October 22: acceptance/rejection notification
November 1st: final papers due, camera-ready


Objectives
The introduction of reasoning capabilities in question-answering (QA) 
systems appeared in the late 70s. A second generation of QA systems, aimed 
at being cooperative, emerged in the late 80s - early 90s. In these 
systems, quite advanced reasoning models were developed on closed domains 
to go beyond the production of direct responses to a query, in particular 
when the query has no response or when it contains misconceptions. More 
recently, systems such as JAVELIN, Inference WEB or Cogex, operating over 
open domains, integrated gradually inferential components, but not as 
advanced as those of the 90s. Performances of these systems in the recent 
TREC-QA tracks show that reasoning components substantially improve the 
response relevance and accuracy. They can also potentially be much more 
cooperative. However, there is still a long way before being able to 
produce accurate, cooperative and robust QA systems, because of the very 
large complexity of natural systems and of the need to make several 
communities work together on common grounds.

Recent foundational, methodological and technological developments in 
knowledge representation (e.g. ontologies, knowledge bases incorporating 
various forms of incompleteness or uncertainty), in advanced reasoning 
forms (e.g. data fusion-integration, argumentation, decision theory), in 
advanced language processing resources and techniques (for question 
processing as well as for generating responses), and recent progress in HLT 
and formal pragmatics (user models, intentions, etc.) make it possible to 
foresee the elaboration of much more accurate, cooperative and robust 
systems dedicated to answering questions from textual data, from e.g. 
online texts or web pages, operating either on open or closed domains.

The workshop will be organized around a few major questions of interest to 
a number of AI, NLP, HLT and pragmatics people. The workshop will be 
focussed on models for intelligently and cooperatively responding to the 
user. This includes areas such as AI models for processing data coming e.g. 
from search engines and models that provide users with explanations and 
arguments about response contents and the way they have been elaborated.
One main question is the characterization of those reasoning procedures 
that need to be developed to answer questions, either on closed or on open 
domains, so that the user exactly percieves the appropriateness of the 
response (e.g. when the response is not the one he expects). Another 
perspective is the role of pragmatics as a means, for example, to better 
capture the user's goals and intentions from his query, and therefore to 
better organize the response and the arguments that justify the response. 
Pragmatics is also of importance to better analyse the potential 
implicatures the user may draw from responses, in particular when the 
response is not direct. Finally, and obviously, natural language 
generation, in connection with the inferantial mechanisms that lead to the 
answer, is a major point.

List of topics (not exhaustive)
·       Question processing: new types of questions (why, how, opinion, 
etc.), reformulation and disambiguisation strategies, interpretation models,
·       Reasoning aspects:
* information fusion-integration,
* detecting and resolving query failure (due to e.g. incomplete data, 
misconceptions or false presuppositions),
* decision making,
* reasoning under uncertainty or with incomplete knowledge,
* models for explaining and arguing about answers.
·       Knowledge representation and integration: (e.g. ontologies, domain 
knowledge).
·       Flexible and interactive systems possibly including a user model, 
recommender systems,
·       Pragmatic dimensions (user intentions, plans and goals recognition 
and generation, conversational implicatures),
·       Language processing:
* question processing,
* response production (planning and argumentation), language generation 
(e.g. lexical choice, planning), specific linguistic aspects of 
argumentation (e.g. marks, connectors),
* explanation production (showing sources and inferences, reporting data 
incompleteness, etc.), argumentation.
·       Evaluation (e.g. component evaluation).

Submission
The goal of this workshop is to enhance cooperation between participants 
with an AI background and the NLP community. Contributors must be opened to 
interactions with the different workshop areas. The programme committee 
will care to have a balanced number of participants from the different 
areas concerned.

To encourage an athmosphere appropriate for a workshop, we plan to:
·       have a 15mn discussion at the end of each session,
·       have a panel on future directions of intelligent question-answering 
and on how the different disciplines can interact as optimally as possible,
·       plan demos on portable machines.

Submission format:
We welcome short papers (max 4 pages), describing projects or ongoing 
research and long papers (max. 8 pages), that relate more established 
results. Papers must be sent in .pdf format. The format to use for papers 
and abstracts is the same as for IJCAI. Please follow the IJCAI formatting 
instructions and use the supplied Word templates or Latex sources. The 
title page (no separate title page is needed) should include the following 
information:
·       Title
·       Authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses
·       Topic(s) of the above list, as appropriate
·       Abstract (short summary up to 5 lines)

"""mark.a.brand"" <affr.m.wbpdh@gmail.com>",Python-Win32 List <kpitck-aew45@python.org>,"Thu, 07 Aug 2008 01:48:17 +1100",[python-win32] wmi query.,"hi:

how do you incorporate a where clause and selected field clause in a wmi
query ?

this gets me caption and state fields for all services
  c = wmi.WMI()
  for service in c.Win32_Service (['Caption', 'State'])
     ...

this gets me all fields for stopped services
c = wmi.WMI()
for service in c.Win32_Service ('State == 'Stopped')
   ....

is the way to incorporate both queries into one something like this
c = wmi.WMI()
for service in c.Win32_Service (['Caption', 'State'])  WHERE ('State ==
'Stopped')

cheers

I don't know all details and it was several years ago so some of my
saying may not be correct. I wasn't involved in the project. Please
contact Jim Fulton from Zope Corp if you are interested in more details.

More than 5 years ago Zope Corp was working on a Berkeley DB backend for
ZODB. It was more of a marketing decision to show large companies that
ZODB is using a well known database instead of a self made one. The
project failed due to problems with the Berkeley db. I vaguely remember
something with transactions and speed ...

That would be to miss the bit where its then required to be voted upon
at an AGM / EGM.

Gareth did ask on IRC about the background behind the decision to
limit OCM membership to two - as I recall, it was partly because it
was felt that the purpose of the committee was simply to provide a
means to opening a bank account and not to replace the somewhat
informal/anarchic way meetings and events had been organised.

However, that does appear to have changed over the years, so I think
the fix is fairly simple.  At the next ILUG event, call an EGM and
pass the following proposal:

That article 4.5 be amended as follows:

The addition of the line ""Additional ordinary committee members may be
elected with the approval of the majority of votes at the AGM.    Any
increase in the number of Ordinary Committees shall be effective only
for the term of that committee.""

In the meantime, as my experience of ILUG committees is that they
usually rule by consensus, I don't see any issue with carrying on as
is.   As Colm points out - the constitution is there to serve the
members, not vice versa.   There's nothing to say the committee can't
invite people to their meetings anyway.

One other point - I understand that the ILUG Chairman also ruled on
the interpretation of section 3.1 and the definition of residence -
may I suggest that http://www.linux.ie/legal/constitution.php be
updated to reflect that, so that there is a record of the ruling.

Don't use a 32bit CPU as a dedicated database server, especially if you are 
working with a large database (with 1 TB storage I assume that you do have a 
large database).

> or... are there ""older"" S-ATA controllers.

In that case I suggest you reevaluate your priorities. Just the cost for the 
raid-controller and the four drives is about 700 Euro.

A new mainboard with a dualcore cpu and 2 GB RAM is about:
  - Mainboard             100 Euro
  - CPU Core2Duo E4700    130 Euro
  - 4 GB RAM DDR2          90 Euro

If you can't afford that price I suggest you visit Ebay and look for a good 
but cheap scsi raid-controller and some 15k scsi disks.

That sounds a bit mysterious. I can not imagine why does it happen just
for this Internet provider... Is there any way to configure postfix that
such e-mail will be rejected with some information send back to sender?

Yes, this is right. Attached file is just cut.

A requirement to publish MX   records in conjunction with DKIM/SMTP policy records benefits: 1- Slightly increased percentage of MX records positively answering   existence probes. 2- Within existing domains, a DKIM/SMTP Policy Record absent MX   records signifies disavowal of DKIM/SMTP. 3- DKIM/SMTP policy records signifying disavowal of DKIM/SMTP can be   empty and not require content interpretation. 4- Asserting policy does not depend upon walking up the domain, but   instead requires publishing empty policy records at existing nodes. 5- This Discovery/Policy assertion strategy safely extends to other   protocols. 6- Does not depend upon wildcards. 7- Expects domains establishing policy to use a strategy that protects   parent domains. 8- Does not modify what is permitted by the parent domain. Item 1 moves SMTP closer to a general mandate of requiring MX records   for message acceptance.  At that time, a need to publish an empty   policy record at every existing domain node would be precluded. Item 2 affords actionable responses to abuse or forgery, as this   offers stronger evidence than invalid or missing signatures provide. Item 3 can terminate even one level domain searches for policy, which   would be highly recommended of any domain utilizing DKIM when such   searching is adopted. Item 4 minimizes memory required, and eliminates impact of changes to   the policy record structure used in conjunction with MX records. -Doug           ------------------------------ _______________________________________________ NOTE WELL: This list operates according to",0,1

I never said fragmentation free. Also, I have read that entire article 
and couldn't find much to support your claim. Care to make some quotes,

$ENV{PERL_CORE} being set right.

I can only guess that you still have two versions of spamassasin 
installed. I would search the disk for multiple copies of 
spamd/spamc/spamassassin and remove the older version. Also remember 
that spamassassin  probably runs as non-root or at least, it should.

True 10"" screen would be sweet alright, if only to make better use of real
estate. They probably use the smaller screen to save battery life.
eeeuser.com has a post about the 10"" screen rumour and they hold that its
not planned at all. Maybe just an Asus ruse to make us buy the 7"" before
they release the larger one though.

Dunno yet!  It's been years since I did a release and I really want to  
check out Anthony's welease tool this time.  I may not have time

It's not marked critical in roundup, and that's the only thing I'm  
going by!  But it doesn't seem critical in the sense that it should  
hold up the alpha release, IMO.

it seems like most of the good ideas have been captured already.  I'll
through two more (low priority) ideas out there.

 1) Randomized test runner/option that runs tests in a random order
(like regrtest.py -r, but for methods)
 2) decorator to verify a test method is supposed to fail

#2 is useful for getting test cases into the code sooner rather than
later.  I'm pretty sure I have a patch that implements this
(http://bugs.python.org/issue1399935).  It didn't fit in well with the
old unittest structure, but seems closer to the direction you are
headed.

One other idea that probably ought not be done just yet:  add a way of
failing with the test continuing.  We use this at work (not in Python
though) and when used appropriately, it works quite well.  It provides
more information about the failure.  It looks something like this:

  def testMethod(self):
    # setup
    self.assertTrue(precondition)
    self.expectTrue(value)
    self.expectEqual(expected_result, other_value)

All the expect methods duplicate the assert methods.  Asserts can the
test to fail immediately, expects don't fail immediately allowing the
test to continue.  All the expect failures are collected and printed
at the end of the method run.  I was a little skeptical about assert
vs expect at first, but it has proven useful in the long run.  As I
said, I don't think this should be done now, maybe later.

limit will not be reviewed. Submission guidelines are to be found in the 
conference website. 
Submitted papers will be evaluated by peer review on the basis of 
originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. 
All accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings. Authors 
of accepted papers are expected to attend the conference and make oral 
presentations about their work. 

Once you have your paper in its final form, please gather the .pdf file, the 
source file (.tex, .doc or .rtf), figure files (.ps, .eps, .pdf), or any 
other file you use to prepare your paper (.dvi files for latex users) 

Submission is electronic. You should introduce paper data and attach the 
compressed file (.zip) by using the submission page.

Are you done for today/tonight?  If so, I can merge the rest.

The last checkin to regrtest I saw looked like it doesn't work.  I
thought it had print foo without parens.  Did I miss something?

Did you make any kind of changes to the config file when you did this? I think
it has something to do with the way the new Waterfall consumes the soul of
it's predecessor.

One thing I really like the idea of with Mercurial for my situation
(non-committer) is the mq extension, which lets me manage my changes
as a ""stack of patches"" - so I'm completely working with patches,
which is what I have to post to the tracker, etc.

Is there a similar workflow in Bazaar? I know there's the loom
extension (although I haven't used it much yet) but I'm not sure how
I'd use that.

Basically, can some Bazaar expert offer a suggestion as to how a
non-developer with read-only access would best use the Bazaar
repositories to maintain a number of patches to be posted to the
tracker?

Thanks,
Paul.

attached is the patch to upgrade CPANPLUS to 0.083_09. This patch
holds a VMS portability fix, and improved 'use sudo' heuristics.

Here's the full changelog:

Changes for 0.83_09     Fri Nov  9 14:17:14 2007
================================================
* Make sure to use $Config{path_sep} to create
   environment variables portably. This addresses
   a test failure on VMS.
* Update 'use sudo' heuristics; if you have $ENV{PERL_MM_OPT}
   set with an INSTALL, LIB or PREFIX option, we assume you
   have write permissions to your install location, and you
   do not need sudo. This can of course be overriden using
   your config.

Dang, ya beat me to it.

It's interesting to me how a simple reframing can change access-control
from a Mystery Unto All But God and Sysadmins, to a game of who's-my-friend.
I expect to see many more informal Facebook-auth apps.  Wanna listen to
my MP3s?  Wanna comment on my blog?  Wanna write on my wiki?  Be my friend.

It may not warn explicitly about that, but it certainly does warn:

M ...
Skipped path/to/missing/file...
M ...
M ...

As someone who deals with svnmerge.py a lot, I find that it is  
appropriate to treat ""Skipped"" as critical as a conflict.

I too wish that it was more explicit in this respect.

We did address many topics on both days, I added the following topics
which were addressed on the Friday BoF only, see
http://wiki.python.org/moin/PackagingBOF

- Linux distributions try to ship only one version of a
  package/egg/module in one release, only shipping more than one
  version if necessary. eggs (as least as shipped with Debian, Fedora,
  Ubuntu) are all built using --single-version-externally-managed.

   - import foo should work wether installed as an egg or installed
     with distutils, and without using pkg_resources.require
   - pkg_resources should handle the situation of one egg version
     installed as --single-version-externally-managed (default version) and
     one or more eggs installed not using
     --single-version-externally-managed. Currently these additional
     versions cannot be imported. 

- It would be useful if setuptools could handle separate build and
  install steps like most configure/make/make install systems do. Access
  to external resources should optionally be disabled during a build.

- The idea was brought up to use a to-be-defined api-version to
  describe dependencies between eggs. Version numbers are generally used
  for more than api changes; the idea follows existing practice for
  shared object names, only changing when the API is changed.

-1. This will make merging code from 2.6 harder, and causes more work
for porting C extensions.

Are these really so closely tied that they have to wait before they
can be backported?

+1. But again, I think this is many small tasks.

+1. I think quite a few changes have not had a fixer added. Again, I
think we should maintain a specific list of needed fixers; fixers can
easily be developed independently.

While I know that some people are expecting to use a development model
that invokes 2to3 very frequently, I think this is at best a
nice-to-have. (I also don't see how it could be done, but maybe I'm
blind for the obvious, as the original author.)

I have some other tasks to add:

- getargs.c (Georg posted about this; his post actually inspired my post.)

- Tweak structseq to be more like namedtuple. Maybe they could have a
common ABC. I also think we should get rid of the concept of ""hidden""
fields (that are accessible by name but not through the tuple API).

- Devise a way to handle str instances pickled in 2.6 and unpickled in
3.0, and also bytes instances pickled in 3.0 and unpickled in 2.6.

- Someone should go over
  https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pCKY4oaXnT81FrGo3ShGHGg
and extract more tasks.

Hello,

I am using SpamAssassin in different versions, for example in 3.2.3 an 3.1.7 in
both version the AWL don't work.

Auto White List is enabled in pre and in local.cf. If I send an email to
arignwj@test.de and then send a email back from arignwj@test.de the AWL do nothing.

I try to find a way to say select this mail as harm.
In earlier version of Spamassassin for example in 3.0.3 the AWL worked correctly.

Any ideas?

Thank you

This PEP wasn't updated explaining the reasons of the rejection, so we

**********************************************************************

Bioinformatics is a challenging and fast growing area of
research, which is of utmost importance for our understanding
of life. Major contributions to this discipline can have
thousands of positive effects in medicine, agriculture, or industry.

The main aim of this workshop is twofold. On the one hand,
to share recent results in this area (new ideas and/or systems,
relying on constraints, but also on linear programming, Mixed
Integer Linear Programming, Local Search, and any other AI techniques,
possibly combining some of them). On the other hand, to present new
challenging problems recently formalized but still far from admitting
an acceptable solutions.

See from the workshop web page, the web pages/proceedings
of the previous editions and the link to the forthcoming special issue
of the Constraints Journal on the same topics.

**********************************************************************

Submitted papers can be

    * Extended Abstracts of new results or
    * Abstract of ongoing works
    * Systems presentations (with demos at the workshop)
    * Summaries of already accepted or recently published results

in any topic concerning bioinformatics and constraints and close techniques.
Submission style is the standard llncs style. Page limit is 6 pages.
Please send the pdf or ps via email to the three co-chairs (email
on the web page of the workshop).

Submission Deadline:      March 15, 2008
Notification to Authors:  April 15, 2008
Camera-ready due:         April 30, 2008 (strict!)
Workshop:                 May 22, 2008.

Workshop participation of at least one author is mandatory.
Participation to CPAIOR is strongly encouraged.

# Please include the string:  [perl #46173]
# in the subject line of all future correspondence about this issue. 
# 



This is a bug report for perl from vnga@schmorp.de,
generated with the help of perlbug 1.35 running under perl v5.8.8.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
[Please enter your report here]

While reading through perlio.c in current 5.8-devel, I found these lines
in PerlIOStdio_close:

   int dupfd = 0;
   ...
   dupfd = PerlLIO_dup(fd);
   ...
   if (dupfd) {

The dup won't be executed on any of my systems, but on those systems
where it is, it seems that if PerlLIO_dup returns 0, the code leaks a
filedescriptor. (Unless PerlLIO_dup does deep magic, but it seems to
simply call dup(), which returns 0 if that fd happens to be free.

just a fyi, really, I don't grok perlio :)

Quite so.  I was just replying to that transformer comment.  With 
switching supplies, transformers are often not used on the input.  The 
incoming AC is rectified, filtered and the resulting DC is used to power 
the switching regulator that provides the desired output voltage(s). 
This process results in a lot of noise, that has to be filtered from the 
power line & load as well as shielded, to prevent interference..

[0]Pickens writes ""The first commercially released [1]personal music
player capable of handling MP3 files was launched in March 1998 ��� the
MPMan F10, manufactured by Korea's Saehan Information Systems with 32MB
of Flash storage, enough for a handful of songs encoded at 128Kb/s. In
the US, local supplier Eiger Labs wanted $250 for the F10, though the
price fell to $200 the following year prompted by the release of the
Diamond Multimedia Rio PMP300. The Rio was released in September 1998,
but by 8 October had become the subject of a lawsuit from the RIAA which
claimed the player violated the 1992 US Home Recordings Act. It was later
ruled that the Rio had not infringed the Act because it was not
responsible for the actions of its customers. Thanks to its lesser known
name, the F10 avoided such legal entanglements, but at the cost of all
the free publicity its rival gained from the lawsuit.""

flaws in IT governance (defined as the specification and control of IT
decision rights), and the difficulty of managing rapidly changing
technology.' Does this fully explain the extreme lack of understanding of
IT at high executive levels? The article is even-handed in apportioning

hasu notes that scientists at the National Institute for Materials
Science at Tsukuba in Japan have created a device, consisting of 17
duroquinone molecules on a gold surface, that can in theory [0]encode 4.3
billion outcomes. The ""device"" does not constitute a practical computer,
since it requires both a scanning tunneling microscope and operation near
absolute zero. A single duroquinone is surrounded by sixteen others, and
weak chemical bonds allow a pulse to the central molecule to shift all
seventeen molecules in a variety of ways. Each duroquinone has four
different ""settings,"" so a single pulse can have 4^16 possible outcomes.
As a demonstration the researchers docked 8 other nano-devices to their
17-molecule computer. It is unclear how well they have characterized the
inputs that result in 4.3 billion different outputs. They are working on
a 3D design that would have 1,024 duroquinone molecules surrounding a
central one.

They are exactly as you fear and yet it runs like a champ. I don't
pretend to know why though...

This is what is generated in /var/log/maillog upon a restart:

Mar  5 01:30:08 mail postfix/postfix-script: stopping the Postfix mail
system
Mar  5 01:30:08 mail postfix/master[25970]: terminating on signal 15

system
Mar  5 01:30:09 mail postfix/master[26119]: daemon started -- version
2.3.3, configuration /etc/postfix

That's it...it stops...it starts...the next line is someone being
rejected for no FQDN in their helo. The whole restart takes a nominal 1
second.

My firewall logs show exactly that. They are connecting on 465 and
cannot auth as they are just a remote sender with mail for one of my
domains. They have no creds to auth with.

I use that port for clients too though...for example, there is a
seminary that cannot seem to connect on port 25 and so they connect on
465/SMTPS with their Outlook clients. If I just remove the restriction
will that affect them any? I would leave the 'smtpd_tls_wrappermode' and
'smtpd_sasl_auth_enable' lines as is, correct?

Also, looking at that makes me see the difference between the 'smtps'
config and the 'smtp' config in master.cf. Why does the 'smtps' seem to
need the 'smtpd_sasl_auth_enable' line and 'smtp' does not? I know you
can connect to the server on port 25 and login to relay your mail, but
it has no 'smtpd_sasl_auth_enable' statement. Is it a hard coded thing?

Also, there's nothing in my proposed solution that would make me an open
relay, is there? I don't see why it would but obviously I am not the
postfix guru here so I better ask :-)

I used the script that comes with postfix to set up the chroot jail. I
did have to put the SQL-related cf files and the Dovecot auth socket in
the jail for postfix to find them but other than that it's been solid.

Now, I want to skip filtering for certain recipients, but only if they

or there are multiple recipients for the same message, the filter should 
still be called.

After reviewing the mailing list and the documentation, I see the only 
solution is using a policy server that looks into the recipient_count

if the recipient=... matches and recipient_count==1. And ""action=FILTER

Are there policy servers around that I can use for this purpose? Or 
perl-based ones that I can hack with minimal effort?

I agree that the dereference syntax is sometimes a bit cumbersome. I have been toying with a few ideas to resolve that: - Something like Perl6::Context - Allow arrays and hashes to contain arrays and hashes directly   (i.e. without references) (main difference with the above would   probably be that copying a hash would copy all the hashes/arrays in   it, instead of making a reference). This would not change the deref   syntax, but would greatly reduce the need for it. - Extend (or create a new one similar to) the arrow operator   to something like '->@' which would mean dereference   to an array.   Thus: C< push @{ $foo{bar} }, 12 > would become:   C< push $foo{bar}->@, 12 >;   Then it would also be possible to remove the @{ ... } completely¹    These ideas are relatively independent of each other, One of the other things I want to do is to not make the sigil change, i.e. C< my %foo; %foo{bar} > instead of C< my %foo; $foo{bar} >. With the no-sigil-change change, removing @{ ... } would be nice, because @baz could be seen as one token referring to the variable @baz. I don't much like the idea of doing automatic dereferences, because I think it would be very unclear when the dereferencing happens (should happen), and thus be error-prone. As grand idea behind all this, I would like to go to a system with six orthogonal datatypes²: + plain value (scalar string/number) + hash + array + code + ref + null With most operators specific to a certain datatype (like [], {}, 'eq', etc already are) ¹ It might be possible to add ->@ to Perl5, I don't think '->@' is current valid anywhere   (but ->$ is in something like $object->$method) ² A lot of things already are in that direction, but I would like to make it stronger,   especially between plain-value, code and ref.

Maybe I should have written ""stops growing significantly"" or ""plateaus""

those warnings are added to the code.  I guess I was really asking if we've

That's not a big problem.  I don't mind creating source distributions for
both for awhile (a couple years anyway).  

    Martin> One option that I envision is that you might keep all sources as
    Martin> 2.x, and only convert to 3.x at installation time, 

How can this ever work?  Aren't there always going to be some
incompatibilities which aren't covered by -3 or 2to3?  Those will require
manual code changes which aren't 2.x compatible.

I view this mostly as an exercise to provide feedback to the greater Python
community, not necessarily a straight-line path to 3.x support in
SpamBayes.

Guido van Rossum <hoauf@python.org>,"zvllln-eum@python.org, smsbmo-9552@python.org","Thu, 07 Aug 2008 23:35:24 -0700",[Python-3000] Invitation to try out open source code review tool,"Some of you may have seen a video recorded in November 2006 where I
showed off Mondrian, a code review tool that I was developing for
Google (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMql3Di4Kgc). I've always hoped
that I could release Mondrian as open source, but it was not to be:
due to its popularity inside Google, it became more and more tied to
proprietary Google infrastructure like Bigtable, and it remained
limited to Perforce, the commercial revision control system most used
at Google.

What I'm announcing now is the next best thing: an code review tool
for use with Subversion, inspired by Mondrian and (soon to be)
released as open source. Some of the code is even directly derived
from Mondrian. Most of the code is new though, written using Django
and running on Google App Engine.

I'm inviting the Python developer community to try out the tool on the
web for code reviews. I've added a few code reviews already, but I'm
hoping that more developers will upload at least one patch for review
and invite a reviewer to try it out.

To try it out, go here:

    http://codereview.appspot.com

Please use the Help link in the top right to read more on how to use
the app. Please sign in using your Google Account (either a Gmail
address or a non-Gmail address registered with Google) to interact
more with the app (you need to be signed in to create new issues and
to add comments to existing issues).

Don't hesitate to drop me a note with feedback -- note though that
there are a few known issues listed at the end of the Help page. The
Help page is really a wiki, so feel free to improve it!

This sums up my opinion pretty well. Hidden by default, but easy to 
expose (e.g. via a local -> .local symlink) for the more experienced 
users that want it more easily accessible.

Cheers,

I'm happy to announce the 15th Irish OpenSolaris User Group meeting:

Topic           Daily DTrace
Date            Thursday October 25th
Time            7:00pm onwards
Location        DIT, Lower Kevin Street, Room KE 3-008

This month, John Rice and Sean McGrath are going to give a demo to show how
DTrace can improve your daily life. I'm going to give a small presentation
at the beginning to introduce the basic concepts of DTrace before they start
to show the magic of DTrace.

DTrace is a dynamic tracing tool that allows you to instrument your whole
operating environment and understand when and where is something happening
within your software stack without modifying it and without any downtime. It
is originally developed for Solaris 10, however it's been currently ported
for other systems like FreeBSD and Mac OS X.

Most people find difficult to understand what can DTrace do for them, what
kind of problems they can solve with it and how to use it to solve them. The
demos are targeted to the broader audience, they're going to show different
DTrace strategies to solve familiar problems for any kind of user: system
administration, networking and software development in both low and high
level languages (C, perl, JavaScript).

This should be a really interesting talk, and I'd definitely encourage you
to come along – please feel free to pass this message around and spread the
word.

As always, we'll also try to give a quick run down of OpenSolaris news over
the past month, and will be recording the talk and adding it to our podcast
feed as well as posting the slides here, in case you can't make it to the
meeting.

Once again, many thanks to the nice folks at DIT for offering to host our
meeting!

              A SERIES OF SPECIAL SESSIONS ON

    Value-Chain Optimisation using Constraint Programming



OVERVIEW

Constraint processing has emerged as an extremely expressive and powerful
paradigm in which to model, solve and reason about many complex problems.
Over the past several decades advances in both the fundamental aspects of
constraint processing and practical applications of constraints have
contributed to making it one of the most promising of Artificial 
Intelligence
technologies.

Over the last decade there has been an increasing interest in supply chain
management or, more generally, the management of complex value-chains.
These can be regarded as complex optimisation problems that must be 
effectively
modelled and solved by state-of-the-art optimisation technologies. These
special sessions aim to present a technical programme representing the
state-of-the-art in using constraints and operations research techniques
to solving complex real world value-chain optimisation problems.


SCOPE

Topics that may be addressed in papers for consideration for inclusion
in this series of special sessions include, but are not limited to:
* optimisation and constraint solving techniques for value chain problems;
* validation of models and solutions: robustness, sensitivity, etc;
* reasoning about uncertainty and change in value chain optimisation;
* distributed and agent-based optimisation across the value-chain;
* optimisation and integrated product development, concurrent engineering,
  Design For X, etc.;
* constraints for decision support;
* scheduling and logistics approaches;
* fundamental advances in constraints and operations research that are
  relevant to value chain optimisation, such as constraint acquisition,
  explanation generation, preference handling, negotiation, etc.;
* hybrid systems for value-chain optimisation involving a significant
  constraint-based element;
* real world applications of optimisation in value chain.


SUBMISSION

Invited papers (6 pages in IFAC double column format) will be reviewed by
at least two referees. As to regular papers, both academic and industrial
oriented communications will be considered. Scientific contributions will
be compiled into several volumes of INCOM06's proceedings. Further 
submission
instructions are available on the symposium website:

                    http://www.emse.fr/incom2006


These sessions will be organised in order to allow ample time for discussion
and demonstration. In particular, while prospective attendees are generally
expected to submit a full paper, as per the conference guidelines, shorter
submissions may also be considered. For example, short statements of 
interest
may also be considered, indicating what perspective and background such
authors will bring to the sessions. We also consider position papers
discussing ""what users need"" or problem statements. ""Real users"" are
especially welcome to provide their perspectives.

The co-chairs will investigate the potential for a special issue of a
journal on value-chain optimisation using constraint programming.


IMPORTANT DATES

Please express your intention of submission now to Barry O'Sullivan
(b.qxjoiltqv@cs.ucc.ie).

Papers submission deadline: November 15th, 2005
Acceptance notification:    January 6th, 2006
Final papers due:           March 1st, 2006


AUDIENCE

This series of special sessions will be of interest to researchers who seek
a deeper understanding of the technical issues associated with modelling and
solving optimisation problems motivated by real world value-chain scenarios
using constraints and operations research techniques. The sessions will also
be of interest to industrialists interested in learning the state-of-the-art
in value-chain-focused optimisation technologies.

anybody out there that want to test a new mysql rpm, that supports the start 
of multiple databases during system startup (and stop during shutdown)?
The new startup script, should become part of openSUSE, but it needs some 
testing, before the script can be integrated.

The rpm and it's dependencies can be retrieved from this repository:
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/database:/mysql51/openSUSE_Factory/repodata/
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/database:/mysql51/openSUSE_10.3/repodata/

The /etc/init.d/mysql script has 2 legs:
- 1 with code that is currently in use (so there is no change in the startup 
script behaviour)
- and a leg with the new code, that starts and stops multiple databases

With a variable in /etc/sysconfig/mysql (or in the sysconfig editor  
Applications/Mysql) one can select which leg to use.  To use the new code the 
variable MYSQLD_MULTI has to be set ""yes"".

The code to start the multiple databases uses mysqld_multi that comes with the 
mysql code to start the databases.

Databases can be added using the databases sections at the bottom 
of /etc/my.cnf

Looking forward to test reports!

FROM THE EDITOR


'Smart switches' is the name of the game
[Shamus McGillicuddy, News Editor]

  Network switch manufacturers are staving off the commoditization of their market by developing intelligent network switches with advanced functionality built right into them. Faster, more robust switches, like the new Nexus line from Cisco Systems may impress people with the number of terabytes they can transfer per second. But it's the management functionality such advanced switches bring that will really help network managers provide better network services. 

For last week's story, I talked to network manager Lou Owayni, who introduced intelligent ConSentry switches to the edge of his network. These smart switches have built-in network access control functionality. They see network activity not as packets, but view it from the context of users, devices and applications -- making it easier for network managers to protect and optimize the network.

Okay. Great. Thanks. It shows that TuxOnIce is trying to free memory (as it should), it's just not succeeding. So everything is working as it ought to (at least as far as the patch goes).

In order to use TOI, you need to download the kernel sources, apply the TOI patches to it, compile and install it.

note is fine. I'll try to track down the problem right away.

There will be a new version of the API out soon that returns more complete
information about embedded photos and videos. If you'd like a sneak peak at
it, you can use any url with 2.1 instead of 2.0 for the version number.

Ex:
http://api.pownce.com/2.1/notes/1748135.xml

I've been working on a new project to standardize embedded photos and video.
More info here: http://oembed.com/

Not that you'll need to use version 2.1 - I'd love to fix the bugs with the
current media link type!

If a word is needed for this concept, then invent a new
one, e.g. ""size unit"", rather than reusing ""byte"", which
everyone already understands as meaning 8 bits.

No, ""char"" and ""unsigned char"" can still be different types.
You just need to say that sizeof(char) == sizeof(unsigned char) == 1,
and leave bytes out of the discussion altogether.

Yes, but there's nowhere that says you can't interpret any text you want 
as a URL.

RFCs in general are interpreted with ""be strict about what you generate, 
and liberal with what you accept"". URLizing text segments fits with that 
spirit, and it does not violate the letter of any RFC I'm aware of.

If you can prove otherwise, please do so.

Well, they don't.. they call it a test for URIs, which is actually 
slightly different, but not really to the point here.

However, in general, it is intended to be a ""test for anything most 
MUA's will interpret as a URI"".

I'd venture to guess neither started it. Eudora predates both products 
by quite an extensive period of time. It could have originated there, or 
in Netscape mail.

Sorry, but I highly doubt you can blame this on microsoftism, nor do I 
think it's any kind of wild incorrectness as you so strongly postulate. 
This has been a very standard feature in email for a very long time. 
It's not a recent development.

It's also a feature that is quite important to accuracy in spamassassin. 
Spammers regularly take advantage of MUA's urlizing text. Regularly.. 
Every day. Adding the ability to detect those domains increases SA's hit 
rate for spam, and that's a good thing. Yes, it causes SA to trigger on 
spam reports, but it generally will do that for other parts of spam 
messages anyway.

Let's face it, your problem isn't with SA detecting a spam domain, it's 
with some idiot filter/rejecting their abuse box.

ECML/PKDD?05 Workshop on ?Mining Spatio-Temporal Data?
Porto, Monday 3rd October 2005

before the
16th European Conference on Machine Learning (ECML'05)
9th European Conference on Principles and Practice of Knowledge
Discovery in Databases (PKDD'05)

Workshop homepage: http://www.di.uniba.it/~malerba/activities/mstd/

Technical description

Spatio-temporal data mining is an emerging research area dedicated to
the development and application of novel computational techniques for
the analysis of large spatio-temporal databases. The main impulse to
research in this subfield of data mining comes from the large amount
of
 * spatial data made available by GIS, CAD, robotics and computer
vision applications, computational biology, mobile computing
applications;
 * temporal data obtained by registering events (e.g.,
telecommunication or web traffic data) and monitoring processes and
workflows.

Both the temporal and spatial dimensions add substantial complexity to
data mining tasks.

First of all, the spatial relations, both metric (such as distance)
and non-metric (such as topology, direction, shape, etc.) and the
temporal relations (such as before and after) are information bearing
and therefore need to be considered in the data mining methods.

Secondly, some spatial and temporal relations are implicitly defined,
that is, they are not explicitly encoded in a database. These
relations must be extracted from the data and there is a trade-off
between precomputing them before the actual mining process starts
(eager approach) and computing them on-the-fly when they are actually
needed (lazy approach). Moreover, despite much formalization of space
and time relations available in spatio-temporal reasoning, the
extraction of spatial/temporal relations implicitly defined in the
data introduces some degree of fuzziness that may have a large impact
on the results of the data mining process.

Thirdly, working at the level of stored data, that is, geometric
representations (points, lines and regions) for spatial data or time
stamps for temporal data, is often undesirable. For instance, urban
planning researchers are interested in possible relations between two
roads, which either cross each other, or run parallel, or can be
confluent, independently of the fact that the two roads are
represented by one or more tuples of a relational table of ?lines? or
?regions?. Therefore, complex transformations are required to describe
the units of analysis at higher conceptual levels, where
human-interpretable properties and relations are expressed.

Fourthly, spatial resolution or temporal granularity can have direct
impact on the strength of patterns that can be discovered in the
datasets. Interesting patterns are more likely to be discovered at the
lowest resolution/granularity level. On the other hand, large support
is more likely to exist at higher levels.

Fifthly, many rules of qualitative reasoning on spatial and temporal
data (e.g., transitive properties for temporal relations after and
before), as well as spatio-temporal ontologies, provide a valuable
source of domain independent knowledge that should be taken into
account when generating patterns. How to express these rules and how
to integrate spatio-temporal reasoning mechanisms in data mining
systems are still open problems.

Additional research issues related to spatio-temporal data mining
concern visualization of spatio-temporal patterns and phenomena,
scalability of the methods, data structures used to represent and
efficiently index spatio-temporal data.

This workshop will focus on research (frameworks, theories,
methodologies, algorithms) and practice (applications, tools and
standards) of knowledge discovery from datasets containing explicit or
implicit temporal, spatial or spatio-temporal information.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together experts in the analysis
of temporal and spatial data mining and knowledge discovery in
temporal, spatial or spatio-temporal database systems, as well as
knowledge engineers and domain experts from allied disciplines.

Topics

The workshop will address all topics of spatio-temporal data mining,
including:
?       Methods for mining temporal, spatial and spatio-temporal data
?       Representation issues in temporal, spatial and spatio-temporal data
?       Fuzzy logic and management of uncertainty in the context of
        spatio-temporal data mining
?       Handling autocorrelation in spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal data
?       Mining time series and trend analysis
?       Discovery of temporal patterns
?       Visualization support to spatio-temporal data mining methods
?       Synergy of visual and computational approaches
?       Empirical studies of performance, other scalability issues
?       Database architectures for spatio-temporal data mining
?       Time-aware queries
?       Parallel and distributed sequence mining
?       Integration of data mining in GIS 
?       Mining spatio-temporal patterns from unstructured documents
?       Applications in various domains, including finance and
        commerce, telecommunications, environment, Earth observation and
        monitoring, urban planning, web/road traffic, bioinformatics
        (protein folding, genomics), etc.

Workshop Structure and Attendance

The workshop aims to be a highly communicative meeting place for
researchers working on similar topics, but coming from different
communities. In order to achieve these goals, the workshop will
consist of two invited talks, followed by short presentations and
longer discussions. A panel session will be organized as the closing
event of the workshop. All workshop participants must also register
for the main ECML/PKDD conference. Workshop attendance will be limited
to registered participants.

Submission Procedure

Authors are invited to submit original research contributions or
experience reports in English. We encourage submission of works
presenting early stages of cutting-edge research and development.
Submitted papers must be unpublished and substantially different from
papers under review. The maximum length of papers is 12 pages.

Papers should be sent electronically (postscript or pdf) not later
than July 25th, 2005 to vpka@di.uniba.it, Subject: Submission to MSTD

Papers will be selected on the basis of review of full paper
contributions. Authors should make certain that the data mining
techniques they describe deal with the special issues that are
associated with spatio-temporal data. Notification of acceptance will
be given by August 15th, 2005. Final camera-ready copies of accepted
papers will be due by September 5th, 2005. The ECML/PKDD organizers
intend to prepare a CD containing all the workshop proceedings. Hence,
electronic submissions to the workshop are essential so that this
could be carried out. A web-publication of the proceedings is also
expected after the conference.

In addition to the ECML/PKDD workshop proceedings, it is intended to
publish a selection of accepted papers in a special issue of the
Journal of Intelligent Information Systems. Style Guide

There is a joint paper style for the proceedings of all ECML/PKDD
workshops. Therefore, papers should be formatted according to the
Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence guidelines.
Authors? instructions and style files can be downloaded from
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.

Neat.  I think I see a few echoes of De Stijl esthetic in Python.

""Proponents of De Stijl sought to express a new utopian ideal of spiritual 
harmony and order. They advocated pure abstraction and universality by a 
reduction to the essentials of form and colour"" from 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_stijl

The group was one of the best things to come out of the Great Stupid War.

I wonder who is next.  Van Doesburg, the group's BDFL?
(I know... wait ;-)

Untitled Document











 Spending on Rich Internet Applications is going to exceed $500M by 2011 !

“It's really time for US enterprises to start switching to the Web as a platform for application delivery. They have stayed in the client-server world for too long, compared to the rapid adoption of Web 2.0 in the consumer space. The easiest way for stepping up to Web 2.0 (Web as a platform) is through the door called RIA.”




								  - BERT HALSTEAD
								  Chief Architect, Curl

For today's (and tomorrow's) applications that run via the Web, should they be AJAX-based - or do AIR/Flash/Flex, JavaFX, or Silverlight offer better results? And what about Appcelerator, OpenLaszlo, or Curl, or any of the other many open source alternatives that have emerged? 

To inspire you to come to AJAXWorld 2008 East and choose your direction for Rich Internet Applications, we bring you here the entire Conference Program, from which you can see that there are sessions covering just about ever RIA technology currently available, whether your interest is AIR 1.0, Flex 2 and 3, Curl 5.0, Open Laszlo 4.0, Silverlight 2.0, Rico 2.0, Zend Framework 1.5, Grails 1.0, Groovy 1.5 - you name it, we have speakers who are knowledgeable about it and giving a session or part of a session about it.


 


Come see why, as a recent ZapThink report predicted,  spending on RIAs is going to exceed $500 million dollars by 2011. No company developing web applications can afford to wait any longer to solidify their Rich Internet Application strategy: 2008 is the Decision Year for RIAs.

				
2008 is the year that US enterprises are switching in increasing numbers to the Web as a platform for application delivery, and 2008 too will for many enterprises be the Decision Year for their choice of RIA platform. Make that choice in New York City in March! AJAXWorld Conference & Expo is the place to be if you want easy access under one roof to a welter of resources, ideas and examples to help you decide.


The extensive Expo floor additionally will allow you to follow up on the premier solutions already available and to choose which best suits your needs. In short, AJAXWorld is where you can discover everything you're going to need for business survival and Web success in 2008. 								
								




Hope to see you in New York City at the 6th International AJAXWorld !

AJAXWorld is the only event in the world to co-locate a full 2-day ""iPhone Developer Summit"" for anyone considering handheld portable devices as a target application platform. 
The founders, CTOs, and leading lights of many of the RIA world's leading pioneers will be giving technical sessions and participating in our unique SYS-CON.TV Power Panels.
All Golden Pass Delegates receive a video archive of all sessions on DVD, so that you can eventually catch up even on sessions you weren't able to attend in person. 
More than 10,000 developers, architects, IT managers, analysts, VCs, and C-Level executives have already attended AJAXWorld.

Edit '/boot/grub/menu.lst'. You will find entries similar to this:

title MAIN openSUSE 10.3 (default)
     root (hd0,5)
     kernel /vmlinuz root=/dev/disk/by-id/ata-ST3160021A_5JS4VV1F-part6 vga=0x317 hwprobe=-modules.pata resume=/dev/hda5 splash=verbose showopts apic
     initrd /initrd


You need ""splash=verbose"".


If you don't like to edit the file directly, you can do the same from 
Yast, boot manager.

Or have str.__repr__() respect per-thread settings, the way decimal
arithmetic does.

Default settings would be in force most of the time; the interactive
prompt would apply the user's settings when repr-ing a result.  This
approach solves the nested-strings problem quite nicely.  But it does
not catch error/warning/log messages when they are generated, unless
the program does *everything* under custom repr settings (dangerous).

There really are two use cases here: a human-readable repr for
error/warning/log messages; and a machine-readable, always-the-same,
ASCII-only repr.  Users want to be able to tweak the former.

For those cases where it is, perhaps one should be

We've been working together for years to make sure Democrats hold to
progressive values and stand up to President Bush. It hasn't always been
easy. But yesterday, something amazing happened.

In what the Washington Post called a ""stunning victory,""1 progressive
underdog Donna Edwards triumphed in her primary against right-wing
Democrat Al Wynn. That's one more vote for ending the war, for affordable
health care, for ending global warming. And thousands of MoveOn members
pitched in time, money, and shoe leather to make it possible.

It's a big deal, because it's not just about this race--it's about
reminding the rest of the Democrats in Congress that at the end of the
day, the voters call the shots.

We need to build on this success--to keep putting pressure on Democrats
who have lost sight of progressive values, even as we gear up to win the
White House in the fall.  Our plan is to use grassroots tactics,
advertising, and yes, more primary elections. We'll do it hand-in-hand
with our partners at the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and
Working for Us PAC.

Can you donate $100 to support a major campaign to hold Democrats
accountable? Click here:

https://pol.moveon.org/donate/democratsaccountable.html?id=12121-4776693-O.m6e2&t=260

In 2006, we helped Democrats take back Congress from the Republicans. And
while many Democrats have stood up against the war and corporate
interests, some have folded.

Holding those people accountable is what we're about. In some cases,
sending a clear message to Democrats may be as simple as flooding their
offices with calls, or running ads in their district on a key issue. In
other cases, getting involved in primary elections is one of the best ways
to hold them accountable. In those cases, we'll look for more strong
progressive challengers like Donna Edwards, and if there is no challenger
in the district, we might help recruit one.

MoveOn members joined with union members and other
progressives--including, ACORN, Democracy for America, EMILY's List, the
League of Conservation Voters, Progressive Maryland, SEIU, Sierra Cub,
United Food and Commercial Workers, Women's Voices, Women's Votes, and
more--to help put it over the top for Donna Edwards.  Together we ran ads
to educate voters, contributed thousands to Donna's campaign, and hit the
streets to turn out voters.

A few months back, we surveyed MoveOn members about Democratic
accountability and over 78% said this should be a major priority for the
year. Donna Edwards' victory is proof that Democrats in Congress who vote
like Republicans can be defeated.  Working with SEIU and Working for Us
PAC, MoveOn members can help fight for a majority that's not just
Democratic, but progressive.

Can you chip in $100 to support our campaign to make it happen now?

I don't much like either of these;  I think option 1 would cause
a lot of confusion and difficulty---it changes a conceptually
simple operation into something more complicated.

As for option 2., I'd agree that there are situations where having
a warning (not an exception) for floating-point equality (and
inequality) tests might be helpful;  but that warning should be
off by default, or at least easily turned off.

Some Fortran compilers have such a (compile-time) warning,
I believe.  But Fortran's users are much more likely to be
writing the sort of code that cares about this.

I disagree with the 'very rare' here.  I've seen, and written, code like:

if a == 0.0:
    # deal with exceptional case
else:
    b = c/a
    ...

or similarly, a test (a==b) before doing a division by a-b.  That
one's kind of dodgy, by the way:  a != b doesn't always guarantee
that a-b is nonzero, though you're okay if you're on an IEEE 754
platform and a and b are both finite numbers.

Or what if you wanted to generate random numbers in the open interval
(0.0, 1.0).  random.random gives you numbers in [0.0, 1.0), so a
careful programmer might well write:

while True:
    x = random.random()
    if x != 0.0:
        break

(A less fussy programmer might just say that the chance
of getting 0.0 is about 1 in 2**53, so it's never going to happen...)

Other thoughts:

 - what should x == x do?
 - what should

1.0 in set([0.0, 1.0, 2.0])

and

3.0 in set([0.0, 1.0, 2.0])

do?

I think that the problem is too complex and open to expect to find a tool
that does the job. The question of what constitutes an
interesting/relevant/useful feature for clustering is hard to answer. One
approach is to go for feature extraction (dimensionality reduction) rather
than feature selection.

If you have not already done so, you could look at the following references:

shared nearest neighbours. IEEE Trans. Comput. C-22, 1025-1034 (1973).

Dear all,

I'm performing a clustering task and need to reduce the amount of my dataset

features (attributes). Looking for a feature selection tool, I've only faced

packages for classification. As I do not have the class information (in my 
dataset) I am not able to use them.

Do you know about any (free) feature selection software for clustering 
tasks?



Thank you so much in advance.

I don't see anything in the bug tracker.  I'd be willing to look at it, 
if this is what we want to do.

py3k supports future imports.  For example, ""from __future__ import 
with_statement"" works, and I presume it's a no-op.  I did not forward 
port print_function, but maybe I should?

One way would be to just ""print"" the page to a PDF. Would this work
for your purposes?

You can try the following command
df -a

I do not understand why people want to mount an nfs mount at boot time.
It seems to me it is a waste of resources. I generally use autofs to do
the worm instead. Another item you could try to use amd.

I have all my /home direcoty run as an automount. whenever you enter the
directory, it will then mount the directory automatically. This keeps
the resource requirements down. I have soft,intr to prevent the system
from hanging if the mount is not available.

It's Python code all the way. Frankly, it's a huge mess, but it would be very
very hard to come up with a scalable solution that would allow to optimize
certain hotspots and redo them in C or C++. There isn't even anything left to
optimize in particular because all those low hanging fruit have already been
taken care of. So it's just ~30kloc Python code over which the total time spent
is quite uniformly distributed :(.

NEUROBIOLOGISTS DISCOVER INDIVIDUALS WHO 'HEAR' MOVEMENT
Individuals with synesthesia, or cross-activated senses, perceive the world differently from others, with some perceiving numbers or letters as having colors or days of the week as possessing personalities. Now, researchers have discovered a type of synesthesia in which individuals hear sounds when they see things move or flash. The scientists say auditory synesthesia, which had never been identified, may represent an enhanced form of how the brain normally processes visual information.

WHY TREATMENT ISN'T EFFECTIVE FOR HIV
Researchers have answered a key question as to why antiretroviral therapy isn't effective in restoring immunity in HIV-infected patients. Once a person is infected with the virus, fibrosis, or scarring, occurs in the lymph nodes -- the home of T cells that fight infection. And once fibrosis occurs, T cells can't repopulate the lymph nodes when HIV therapy begins, according to a professor of medicine and principal investigator on the study.

CERTAIN HIV TREATMENT LESS EFFECTIVE WHEN USED WITH ANTI-TB THERAPY
Patients receiving rifampicin-based anti-tuberculosis therapy are more likely to experience virological failure when starting nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy, an HIV treatment that is widely used in developing countries because of lower cost, than when starting efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy, according to a study in the Aug. 6 issue of JAMA, a theme issue on HIV/AIDS.

ONE IN TEN CHILDREN USING COUGH, COLD MEDICATIONS
Researchers have found that approximately one in ten US children uses one or more cough and cold medications during a given week. Pediatric cough and cold medications are widely marketed in the U.S. but surprisingly little is known about just how often they are used in children. This information is especially important in light of recent revelations that cough and cold medications are responsible for serious adverse events and even deaths among children.

You seem somehow both worried about security, yet too lazy to type in
your password.  I think at some point, one of those concerns is going

Sorry, I only know my way around the libc version of getpass(), not
the python one.  In that version, typically we try to open /dev/tty
for reading, and if that fails, we fall back to stdin.  I presume
that's what's going on here, but the first line appears to be getting
stdin anyway, so I'm no longer sure.  That said, why don't you just
use default_getpass() in your code, if it reads from stdin to begin
with?

I don't know where the ""Unable to make anything but miniperl in this

It's for some sort of rynsc-like feed (I don't believe it uses rsync). I 
don't believe they offer (a).

Yeah, it's just a bottom line reality that the cheapest fee they will 
accept ($1450/year) in no way corresponds to any sort of bottom-line ROI. 
The cost is out of line with the value of their service.

Yes, sorry...I meant URIBL. The SURBL people have always been very cool.

Leon Peshkin <ptzqe@hms.harvard.edu>,faq@engr.orst.edu,"Wed, 06 Aug 2008 13:10:52 -0400",[UAI] RESEARCH POSITIONS IN Computational Biology: intelligent image processing and bioinformatics applications,"http://cbi.med.harvard.edu/careers.php

The CBI at Systems Biology Department of Harvard Medical School is now 
accepting applications for two Research Fellowships:

Matlab engineering for intelligent image processing   and  
Bioinformatics applications development.

  “Matlab engineering for intelligent image processing”

The Computational Biology Initiative of Systems Biology Department at 
Harvard Medical School is looking to hire a research fellow to pursue a 
project in Intelligent Image Processing.

When: Negotiable. Preferably starting immediately for 3-4 months.

Who: Graduate or advanced undergraduate student with exceptional 
engineering/ research skills.

What: Designing, implementing and integrating various Machine Learning 
and Image Processing algorithms to create high throughput intelligent 
biological image analysis tool ""Cellog."" Some keywords: Active contour, 
Markov Random Fields, N-cuts, segmentation and tracking.

Skills: Virtuoso of Matlab, comfortable with structures and UI (user 
interface) design. Familiarity with Unix and Mac OS X. No biological 
background required.

Data: data is collected at Dr. G. Lahav Laboratory. Images are taken 
using Nikon2000E inverted florescence microscope with x40 air objective 
(Plan Apo).

The research is on proteins' level and localization in single living 
human cells (epithelial adherent cells from MCF7 line, human breast 
cancer cells which express wild type p53). In particular, we are 
studying the negative feedback loop between the tumor suppressor p53 
and its inhibitor Mdm2 by fusing them to fluorescent proteins (CFP and 
YFP).  We create time-lapse movies of 24-48 hours, taking (parallel 
phase and two fluorescence channel) images every 15 minutes.

To apply: contact Dr. Leon Peshkin (ptzqe@hms.harvard.edu) with a brief 
informal description of your background and interests.

I'm afraid it's not entirely clear what you're asking
for here. To open a .chm file you can just use os.startfile.
To open it a little more precisely, you can call hh.exe
with the subprocess.call function and some suitable params.

If you need more than that, you'd better come back with a
more specific enquiry.

Yeah,  I remember that discussion.
But for me,  it reliably gives 2-2.5 MB.

Weird eh ?

Both houses would have been the same exchange (phibsborough ) as well.

That's why I reckon the safest thing to do is to ask people who live
geographically
nearby, on the same street if possible.

Interesting chat transcript below.


http://www.mainewebreport.com/2007/10/11/the-anti-moveon-ads-google-wont-let-you-see/

Robert Cox has a piece in today's Examiner about Google's restriction
of ads I tried to place with them on behalf of the Collins for Senator
campaign:

    Internet giant Google has banned advertisements critical of
MoveOn.org, the far-left advocacy group that caused a national uproar
last month when it received preferential treatment from The New York
Times for its ""General Betray Us"" message.
    The ads banned by Google were placed by a firm working for
Republican Sen. Susan Collins' re-election campaign. Collins is
seeking her third term.
    Earlier this week, Google told Lance Dutson, president of Maine
Coast Designs, that the ads he placed for Collins had been removed and
would not be allowed to resume because they violated Google's
trademark policy.

This story is currently #1 on the Examiner's 'most popular' list
across the country. It has been linked by the Drudge Report,
Instapundit, Michelle Malkin, Right Voices, and many other blogs.
People have been asking to see the actual ads, so I'm posting them
here, along with the text of a support chat I had with a Google
representative about their suspension of the ads:
Google bans anti-MoveOn.org ads

Chat transcript:

    Thank you for contacting Google AdWords. Please hold a moment
while we route your chat to a specialist
    who will help you with your question: ""I have a question about an
ad rejection "".
    AnnaMarie has received your message and will be right with you.
    Lance Dutson: acct ******
    AnnaMarie: Hello Lance. Thanks for contacting Google AdWords. I'm
happy to help you.
    Lance Dutson: i received a message saying my ads violated trademark
    Lance Dutson: and i want to know if you received a specific
complaint about them
    AnnaMarie: I won't be able to give you that information Lance.
    AnnaMarie: You can request permission to use a trademarked term
from a trademark owner though.
    Lance Dutson: Is there a protocol for appealing a suspended ad
through google?
    AnnaMarie: No there is not. We do not handle trademark disputes.
    Lance Dutson: Because the suspension does not seem to meet
reasonable trademark standards
    Lance Dutson: So if anyone complains, you simlply pull the ad?
    AnnaMarie: The term MoveOn is a trademarked term.
    AnnaMarie: We proactively disapprove ads that have a trademarked
term in them, unless the advertiser in
    question has permission to use the term.
    Lance Dutson: Let me show you something:
    Lance Dutson:
    http://tinyurl.com/ywxwyf
    AnnaMarie: Again, we do not handle trademark disputes Lance.
    Lance Dutson:
    http://tinyurl.com/yoo89f
    Lance Dutson: These are also trademarked terms
    Lance Dutson: Microsoft without question
    Lance Dutson: there are thousands of trademarked terms in Google AdWords
    AnnaMarie: Again, advertisers that run on trademark terms do have
permission to use them.
    AnnaMarie: If you'd like to use the term you can contact the
trademark owner Lance.
    Lance Dutson: And then what would I do after I get permission?
    Lance Dutson: Do I contact Google?
    AnnaMarie: The owner would have to send notification to us, then
our trademark team would have to approve that.
    Lance Dutson: So you're telling me Blackwater sent you permission
to run negative ads against them?
    AnnaMarie: If you'd like, I can speak with our trademarks team and
let you know who you can contact to
    get permission to run an ad with that ad text.
    Lance Dutson: Yes that would be great.
    AnnaMarie: Is there a good email address to reach you at Lance?
    Lance Dutson: tvxkj.gbwxii@gmail.com
    AnnaMarie: OK, once I hear from our trademarks team, I will email
you with the process for getting approval.
    AnnaMarie: Is there anything else I can help you with today lance?
    AnnaMarie: Lance*
    Lance Dutson: Yes I would also like to find out how I get
information on whether or not a complaint was filed.
    Lance Dutson: According to DMCA, I have the right to know if a
complaint was filed.
    AnnaMarie: You cannot request that information Lance.
    AnnaMarie: Again, I will check with our trademarks team and let
you know what I find out.
    Lance Dutson: Ok that would be great.
    Lance Dutson: Thanks for your help today.
    AnnaMarie: You're welcome.

In retrospect, I think I was incorrect about DMCA applying here. Also,
I replaced the long URL I actually gave to the representative with a
TinyURL version here, to neaten it up.

True, but it's just more moving parts to break, especially when I  
don't really feel a u/i buys you much[*].

I have shared domains with local and remote mailboxes.

I have configured the virtual_alias_domains and virtual_alias_maps but I have 
this strange behaviour:
let's suppose that the domain is mydomain.com and that I have one account for 
ktrq2@mydomain.com
if I write to ktrq2@some.other.server.com this mail is delivered to 
ktrq2@mydomain.com

It seams that the server is ignoring the virtual_alias_domains and rewrite 
everything is mathing the map query. In case of no matching in 
virtual_alias_maps it forwards remotely to the correct relay.

I was actually looking at something Fred wrote and managed to misread it 
as something you had posted - and it turns out Skip was just agreeing 
with Fred about the 'provide an option to tell distutils to use a 
different user-specific directory name than the default one' idea, and 
isn't particularly worried about where the packages go by default.

Sorry for the confusion.

Cheers,
Nick.

Blocking a revision makes my job as The Merger easier.

I'm not so sure about the merging part. It takes some experience with
the Python 3.0 code base to know the subtle differences in the C API.
Most merges are straight forward for me. If you enforce the forward
merging on every developer it may slow down development.
Each regular merge takes me about 45 minutes of computer time but less
than 15 supervisor time. The computer time is mostly compile and test
time in the background. If everybody merges her own code to 3.0 it still
takes *everybody* about 10 minutes of time and 45 minutes of computer time.

attached is the patch to upgrade C::D::Build to 0.06_02. These are
all portability fixes as reported by Craig Berry and a small test
fix to work with CPANPLUS > 0.83_08.

Here's the full changelog:

  - Various VMS portabillity fixes from John Malmberg &
    Craig Berry.
  - With CPANPLUS 0.83_08, dslip information is being retrieved from any
    module defined in the package. Missing dslip info therefor uses the
    module tree, which we are trying to avoid in the test suite.
    So, we define the dslip info explicitly and no module trees are  
being
    used.
  - Update t/inc/conf.pl from its CPANPLUS counterpart
  - Add callback routine to allow to continue testing/installing  
after a failed test
  - Update Makefile.PL to reflect dependency on CPANPLUS 0.80

A note to Ken: This release has not been uploaded to CPAN. If it proves
stable, we should roll a new C::D::Build release.

In my experience, a value in /etc/inittab stood. But then, I have never 
used autoyast. How about removing autoyast? I suppose it is not needed 
after installation. Perhaps it is a bug. Perhaps it is a feature, to 
configure all the computers the same, even after installation.

Hi dave,

thanks but that is not true, this is already correctly configured on the OS 
(centOS 5) but still postfix looks at dns first. I put smtp:[mailserver] in 
the transporttable and in the hosts file I put: 192.168.0.3 mailserver but 
still postfix complains that it can't find mailserver.

I tried disable_dns_lookups=yes but that causes a bunch of other problems 
because then postfix doesn't look at dns at all.

   International Conference on Integration of AI and OR Techniques
  in Constraint Programming for Combinatorial Optimisation Problems


                         CP-AI-OR'05


           May 30-June 1, 2005, Prague, Czech Republic

                  http://cpaior05.mff.cuni.cz/
                 fckpyo74@cpaior05.mff.cuni.cz


After a successful series of five CP-AI-OR international workshops (Ferrara,
Paderborn, Ashford, Le Croisic, and Montreal) devoted to integration of
Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research
techniques, in 2004 CP-AI-OR became a conference with the first meeting held
in Nice (France) with more than 100 participants. In 2005, the Second
CP-AI-OR Conference will be held in Prague (Czech Republic), a beautiful
city in the heart of Europe.

The aim of the conference is to bring together interested researchers from
AI and OR, and to give them the opportunity to show how the integration of
techniques from AI and OR can lead to interesting results on large scale and
complex problems. We explicitly welcome new ideas and methods for
integrating OR and AI techniques that have arisen from real-world
applications.

CP-AI-OR is intended primarily as a forum to focus on the integration and
hybridization of the approaches of CP, AI, and OR technologies. A secondary
aim is to provide an opportunity for researchers in one area to learn about
techniques in others. Therefore, papers that actively combine, integrate or
contrast approaches from more than one of the areas are solicited. High
quality pure papers from a single area are eligible provided that they are
of interest to other communities involved.

As in previous years, CP-AI-OR'05 will be preceded by a Master
Class where leading researchers give introductory and overview talks
in a given area. This year, the topic of the Master Class will be
Metaheuristics and Constraint Programming. In the morning, an overview
of the main metaheuristics will be given by leading researchers in the
area and the afternoon will be devoted to some combinations of constraint
programming and metaheuristics. The Master Class is intended for PhD
students, researchers, and practitioners.



The program committee invites submissions that include but are not limited
to the following topics:

- - Integration of constraint relaxation methods, e.g. Constraint propagation,
 Cutting planes, Reduced costs, Global constraints, Graph algorithms,
 Dynamic programming, Lagrangean and convex relaxations, Heuristic functions
 based on constraint relaxation.

- - Integration of search and solving methods, e.g. Branch and bound,
 Intelligent backtracking, Incomplete search, Randomized search,
 Column generation and other decomposition methods, Local search,
 Meta-heuristics.

- - Forms of integration, e.g. Static/dynamic problem decomposition,
 Linking variables and constraints in different solvers,
 Transformations between models and solvers,
 Methods using information derived by other solving methods,
 Collaboration between concurrent methods, models, and solvers.

- - Problems, modeling, and applications.

I don't know, but we'll find out!  The first time (in years) will be a

Hmm. There's not a lot of consistency here:

>>> int(b'1')

>>> float(b'1')
1.0
>>> complex(b'1')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File """", line 1, in

So int and float accepts bytes, while complex, Decimal and Fraction do
not...

After following this thread for a bit, I think it's a wart 
already.  :)  The potential for confusion with the other *assign 
target idea is too high.

I don't have a problem with ""item for *item,val in blah"", but ""*item 
for item in blah"" makes my head hurt.  Why not just say ""i2 for i1 in 
blah for i2 in i1""?  Yes, it's a bit more verbose, but not frequent 
enough to justify the *, and you can tell what's going on by 
textually transposing to the nested for loops.  Plus, it works for 
any depth.  What are you going to do if it's triple-nested?  Use 
**?  What about ***?  Where does it end?

So I think ""yield *"" and ""*item for item in..."" are broken for the 
same reason.  In the function call use case, and in simple 
assignment, it is treated as a literal quasi-textual 
expansion.  However, such an expansion in the yield case would yield 
a tuple, and the literal expansion in the comprehension case would 
make no sense.  (If done by true textual substitution, it would have 
to be a syntax error.)

And I think that a quasi-textual substitution is the right mental 
model for * expressions, as it's simple to explain and easy to reason 
out what happens.

                              CALL FOR PAPERS

                                  CIR'07
        2nd International Workshop on Context-Based Information Retrieval
		 http://wwwsi.supelec.fr/bld/CIR-07/
		    	     August 20-21, 2007

Held in conjunction with the 6th International and Interdisciplinary  
Conference on Modeling and Using Context (CONTEXT-07),  
http://context-07.ruc.dk

********************************************************************************

SCOPE

With the explosion of the volume of available information on the Web, the
information retrieval systems (IRSs) have become necessary to help the
users to find relevant documents. Traditional IRSs may be drastically
different if they take into account the context of the information, the
context of the interactions and the context of the query. Contextual
information includes, for example, both explicit and implicit feedback from
the user, environment the user is attached to and the system itself. Such
factors constrain the search without intervening in it explicitly. One idea
to improve the efficiency of IRSs is to make the contextual information
explicit in order to enhance the retrieval performance.

The workshop audience is intended to explore related work, theoretical
framework and applications which focus on contextual IRSs. It is intended
for researchers in the area of computer science, information retrieval and
digital libraries, artificial intelligence and cognitive science.
The workshop aims at promoting exchanges in these
fields, establishing the current state of the art,identifying the emerging
problems and proposing future research directions. Besides, we encourage
interested researchers from related areas to attend the workshop.

Relevant topics include but are not limited to:

- Theory in context and information retrieval
- Contextual information retrieval modeling
- Multiple contexts in information retrieval, navigation and browsing

This actually works but I had ""permit_mynetworks"" before 
""check_recipient_access hash:/etc/postfix/protected_lists"" which of 
coarse, allowed all local users.

Given this, we have ""permit_mynetworks,check_client_access 
hash:/etc/postfix/pop-before-smtp,permit_sasl_authenticated,reject_unknown_recipient_domain,reject_unauth_destination"" 
on another server and I do not think the order is correct and where I 
would enter the new restriction and what would be the best order for 
""smtpd_recipient_restrictions?""

.

The 'egg' is your problem, py2exe is currently not able to handle them 
'out of the box'.

I had a similar problem with sqlalchemy (thread: sqlalchemy 0.4.x and 
py2exe) Simon King provided a script in that thread which I used as the 
base for mine.

An invitation from the Vice-Chancellor Designate
Dear Colleagues,Later this year, when Parliament allows, I will 
      be taking up the position of Vice-Chancellor. In the meantime Professor 
      Ian Warrington has accepted the Council’s invitation to be the Acting 
      Vice-Chancellor. I am very grateful to Professor Warrington for taking up 
      this role.Massey is a unique university. It is a successful 
      university. It has a reputation for excellence in teaching and research, 
      for innovation and for links with the community.But all of us know 
      Massey, like all universities, faces new challenges. The arrival of a new 
      vice-chancellor offers an opportunity to take stock and rethink 
      strategies.So we can move ahead quickly when the time comes, over 
      the next few months I want to encourage a discussion focusing on the 
      future of our University.To begin this process, you are invited to 
      attend one of the sessions listed on the right where I will be outlining 
      ideas, principles, priorities and activities that could guide our 
      development.The sessions are part of a dialogue that will include 
      visits to as many groups within the University as possible. There will 
      also be meetings with our key stakeholders.I believe Massey can be 
      New Zealand’s defining university. We can reflect what New Zealand is 
      today and provide leadership for the future. To achieve this we will need 
      to focus our activity and drive so as to attain pre-eminence both 
      nationally and internationally in our areas of specialisation while 
      maintaining excellence in everything we do.I know that recent 
      years have been difficult at times. No one can promise the future will be 
      easy! I firmly believe, however, that with agreement amongst the 
      University community about our direction we can look forward to Massey 
      being universally acknowledged as a world centre of higher 
      education.I look forward to talking with you and I hope you will 
      take time to send me your thoughts via umqbrcne@massey.ac.nz

Like which incompatibilities specifically? I'm not aware of any.

There are certainly incompatibilities, but I am not aware of a case
where you can't write the code so that it works correctly in 2.x, and
then works also correctly after 2to3 has done its thing. Most likely,
this wouldn't work for SpamBayes as-is, but I can't see why it couldn't
work for SpamBayes when-changed.

Sure. As an exercise, I think it would be most useful if you actually
tried to implement some strategy for SpamBayes that you think other
projects could realistically also follow, and the report if and how
this strategy falls short.

Martin

THEME:

Decision-Making Support Systems (DMSS) are computer-based systems that
support one or several phases of the individual, team, organizational or
inter-organizational decision making process (Forgionne et al, 2000).
Research on DMSS can be focused on both organizational and technical
issues. From a technical perspective, advances in Information Technologies
(IT) have improved the support capabilities for DMSS (Forgionne, Gupta and
Mora, 2002). In particular, Artificial Intelligence (AI) (Doyle et al,
1996), has been recognized as a significant enhancement tool for DMSS
(Goul, Henderson and Tonge, 1992; Pomerol, 1995; Eom, 1998) and
agent-based technologies promise a new generation of intelligent DMSS
(Garrido, Brena and Sycara, 1998). Despite the relevant  progress in both
DMSS/OR and AI research, efforts have been not coordinated (Simon, 1987),
and the majority of the publications are highly focused on either
organizational or technical perspectives (Forgionne, Kohli and Jennings,
2002). We estimate that a summarization and organization of the main
findings in both fields are necessary to help focus the discussion on an
integration of the tools for effective decision-making support (Mora et
al, 2003). The proposed special issue of the Journal of Decision Systems
will help: (i) to generate a compendium of quality theoretical and applied
contributions in Intelligent Decision-Making Support Systems (i-DMSS);
(ii)  to disseminate scarce knowledge about foundations, architectures and
effective and efficient methods and strategies for successfully designing,
developing, implementing, and evaluating Intelligent Decision-Making
Support Systems, and (iii) to create a bridge between DMSS and AI
researchers and practitioners and awareness of the relevance of
Intelligent Decision-Making Support Systems in the current complex and
dynamic management environment (Gupta and Sharma, 2004).

Fine by me. If Barry has no issue with that I will drop all of their
priority to urgent. But until then I will just keep doing immediate
and change them en-mass.

The Momentum Behind Service-Oriented Systems is Intense
SOA is in many ways more of a mentality than a specific set of capabilities. Whats its precise purpose? What's the business value? Why are so many enterprises pursuing it? What does SOA Management and Governance have to do with it? Why is SOA happening now? How should I think about SOA for my organization? How do I manage SOA projects? 

Services-oriented architecture provides a framework and a set of interfaces that can help companies deliver new applications more rapidly and flexibly. Big application vendors, including Sun, IBM, Microsoft, and BEA have all these questions - as well as the whole emerging question of SOA/virtualization synergy - on their minds, and so should you.

Find your answers at SOA World Conference & Expo 2008 East !


Great Keynotes on Service-Oriented Architecture

""Making the SOA Leap""SOA continues to be the hottest buzzword in 2008. But just what is it thats valuable about the move to SOA? And how can your IT organization make the leap, and make the leap valuable to your business? In this keynote, Richard Mark Soley, Executive Director of the SOA Consortium, will show how the Consortium is making great strides in defining SOA to be a valuable business strategy for business agility, taking advantage of Enterprise Architecture, Business Process Management and other concepts. He will also share some of the experience gained from the SOA Consortium's Summit discussions with CIOs, CTOs and Chief Enterprise Architects who have results to share from refocusing their lines of business around recognizable, reusable and optimizable business processes


""The Future of the Virtual Enterprise""While everyone wants to do SOA right the first time, the typical results are not always stellar. This keynote, by well-respected industry veteran David Linthicum, is a must-attend for those looking to get SOA right the first time. The pitfalls of building any complex architecture, including SOA, are something that the SOA practitioners must contend with, and most are ill-equipped. In this keynote presentation Linthicum will take the mystery out of SOA requirements, design, and implementation - not just by providing hype-driven concepts, but a step-by-step approach for building an SOA that works each and every time, no matter how complex or simplistic the problem domain, business issues, or technology solution.

I'm using all of Matthias' current releases and I seem to have an issue. 
  3 times in the past week hibernation has hung while writing caches. 
It's not at the same point and I've tried varying size hibernations. 
Sometimes it's halfway and sometimes it's during the 1st 100mb.  I have 
2gb RAM and a 2gb swap partition.

Any ideas???

   Usually you do this with a combination of trusted_networks and exclusion in your 
scanner. For example, my qmail/qmail-scanner/SA configuration is set up not to spam scan 
messages that enter my mail system from the LAN, or authenticated/secure outside senders.

Correct. There are also some additional shell scripts involved, but I
don't think they matter.

Don't know, though with using GMail I just set the filters on the web

Ninth International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics
http://anytime.cs.umass.edu/aimath06/

January 4-6, 2006
Fort Lauderdale, Florida

Paper Submission Deadline: October 2, 2005

The International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics is a 
biennial meeting that fosters interactions between  mathematics, theoretical 
computer science, and artificial intelligence.  This is the ninth symposium in 
a series, which is sponsored by Annals of Mathematics and Artificial 
Intelligence.  We seek submissions of recent results with a particular emphasis 
on the  foundations of AI and mathematical methods used in AI.  Papers 
describing applications are also encouraged, but the focus should be  on 
principled lessons learned from the development of the application. 
Traditionally, the Symposium attracts participants from a variety of 
disciplines, thereby providing a unique forum for scientific exchange. The 
three-day symposium includes invited speakers, presentations of technical 
papers, and special topic sessions.


INVITED SPEAKERS

   o  Thomas Dean, Brown University, USA
   o  Carla Gomes, Cornell University, USA
   o  Jeffrey S. Rosenschein, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel


SPECIAL TOPIC SESSIONS

TBA


PAPER SUBMISSION:

Paper submission will be electronic via the submission link on the symposium 
web site.  Papers, no more than (8) pages long, must be submitted in PDF or PS 
format.  Fonts must be at least 10 point, and either a single or double column 
format may be used.  The submission deadline is October 2, 2005 (11:59PM EST). 
Papers will be reviewed by members of the Program Committee.  Authors will be 
notified of acceptance or rejection by October 31, 2005.  Final versions of 
accepted papers, for inclusion in the conference electronic proceedings, are 
due by November 21, 2005.  Note that papers may be submitted to the Symposium 
even if submitted to other conferences or journals, because the Symposium web 
site is not archival.

Full versions of a selected set of papers from the Symposium will be included 
in a special volume of Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, 
published by Springer.  Authors of these selected papers will be invited to 
submit their full version subject to refereeing at the usual high standards of 
the journal and will receive more details with the acceptance notice.

Any questions regarding paper submission should be sent to the program chair, 
Shlomo Zilberstein .

I've found it extremely useful to have access to dependency information
when making Debian packages automagically out of setuptools tarballs.

It's not easy or robust to access/use it, but for my simple pure python
packages, it's been working wonderfully.

At least I'm not FORCED to use Microsoft..... not yet anyways.  And I found it's best just to let the masses of people ""believe"" they are safe with Microsoft Windows..... it helps the government's surveillance of everyone.

You probably want to use WWW::Mechanize instead of LWP.

It seems you are not too familiar with login techniques, from the way you posted the question. I'm not sure what type of login you are trying to access. Usually, it is server basic auth, but if it is some kind of custom login page, which dosn't use basic auth, and redirects you and sets a cookie, you will need WWW::Mechanize. But, if it is the normal server basic authorization, the following script should show you how to login with lwp. Notice the HTTP::Request::Common module( which needs Crypt::SSLeay for https, IIRC), and the line $req->authorization_basic($user, $pass); that is for basic server auth. If that don't work, you will need WWW::Mechanize. # this posts a file after basic auth login #!/usr/bin/perl use warnings; use strict; use LWP::UserAgent; use HTTP::Cookies; use HTTP::Request::Common qw(POST); my $https_url = 'https://zentara.zentara.net/~zentara/cgi-bin/uploads/up1.cgi'; my $https_user = 'zentara'; my $https_pass = 'foobar'; my $file = 'testout.tgz'; &postHTTPS(); sub postHTTPS {         my $ua = new LWP::UserAgent;         $ua->protocols_allowed( [ 'https'] );         $ua->cookie_jar(HTTP::Cookies->new(file =>"".cookies.txt"",autosave => 1));   #setup request         my $req = POST($https_url,  	        Content_Type => 'multipart/form-data', 	         	        Content =>[        	 		           file =>[ $file  ],         		  ], );   #setup auth        $req->authorization_basic($https_user, $https_pass);   #do post          	 my $response = $ua->request($req); 	 if ($response->is_error())         	{         	        printf "" %s\\n"", $response->status_line;         	        print ""https request error!\\n"";         	} else {         	        my $content = $response->content();         	        print ""$content\\n""; 		        }          if ( $response->is_success ) {                    print $response->as_string;          }else {                print $response->status_line;          } }           __END__ zentara --  I'm not really a human, but I play one on earth. http://zentara.net/japh.html",0,1

ABOUT THIS FEATURED WHITE PAPER SPONSORED BY HP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Given the complexity of implementing Unified Communications, you must
carefully evaluate and design an architecture that will not only
provide the desired feature set, but also provide the required levels
of scalability and high availability needed to support UC. This paper
uncovers a solution for implementing a modular platform that
decreases cost and complexity as opposed to the traditional rack or

Actually, they both have them.  Windows has Cygwin (rpm-based), while
for MacOS Fink (deb-based), MacPorts (FreeBSD ports-like), and
NetBSD's pkgsrc are all viable options if you want packaging support
for 3rd-party packages.

for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux are available here:

   http://www.activestate.com/products/komodo_ide/
   http://www.activestate.com/products/komodo_edit/


What's New in Komodo 4.3.0
==========================

- New **Unit Testing Integration** for Python, Ruby, PHP and Perl.
Currently the Python support is for basic unittest-based test suites. In
subsequent versions we plan to add nose support. (Komodo IDE-only)

- New **Replace in Files** provides full and *safe* replace
functionality across whole source trees. There is a preview of changes,
and undo support.

- New **Find in Project** and significant improvements to the find
system to make it more convenient to find stuff.

- A new **Abbreviations** editor feature to quickly insert code
snippets. You'll never have to manually enter this again:

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       ...

- Komodo Edit is now open-source! Back in October, we announced the Open
Komodo project. We did that by November, but this release is finally the
first full open-source release of a Komodo app. A lot of Komodo is
written in Python (and XUL and JavaScript). We'd love for some of you to
get involved:  http://www.openkomodo.com/


ActiveState at PyCon
====================

Todd Whiteman, one of the core Komodo developers, will be at PyCon in
Chicago this weekend. He'll be giving a lightning talk (on Friday) on
some of the cool PyXPCOM -- plugging Python into Mozilla -- work that
he's been doing.

He'd be happy to talk Komodo-shop with you.


About Komodo
============

Komodo IDE is a commercial multi-platform integrated development
environment for dynamic languages (Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP, JavaScript)
and web tech (HTML, CSS, XML, XSLT): full-featured debuggers; code
browsing; Subversion, CVS and Perforce integration, regular expression
toolkit (Rx); interactive shells; and everything in Komodo Edit.

Komodo Edit is the free and *open-source* little brother of Komodo IDE.
It is a multi-platform, multi-language editor that kicks ass. Features
include:

- an excellent editor (based on Scintilla)
- autocomplete and calltips for many languages
- Vi and Emacs keybindings
- background syntax checking
- syntax coloring for dozens of languages (including template languages
like Django's template language)
- schema-based XML autocomplete
- full project support
- remote files
- extensibility via Python or JavaScript macros, or via Firefox-style
extensions
- multi-language file support (get HTML, CSS and JavaScript autocomplete
all in one HTML file!).



If you tried Komodo before and weren't happy, give it another try. Let
us know what you think here:

Hi Neil

like jdd, I was hoping to avoid this debate.  It's only flogging a dead
horse.  My list of reasons is/was intended as a statement, they're not
really open to debate.  

Nevertheless - 

Webbased forums need software too - it's called a webbrowser.  Usenet is
as accessible as a website, both provided you've got the right
software.

Let me know how you propose to _guarantee_ that the interface does _not_
change when I change forum.

I suspect you're probably young, and perhaps even a little
inexperienced.  Nothing wrong with that, so am I :-)
I track/follow maybe 40 or 50 mailing-lists. Not every day and not
equally, but I probably check in on maybe 20-25 public lists every day. 
All I need to do is switch to knode, and do a ""Get all new articles"",
then I know which groups have updates and which don't.  All on ONE
screen, not 25.

Here's a screenshot from my knode:

Which is not proper threading.  You may be showing your inexperience a
little here.  See the screenshot above for an example of threading.

Nope.  I login to my workstation, the rest goes by itself.  And I can
read/post/whaetever after that.

Not really - like I said, those 5 reasons are from an article I wrote
two years ago.  They haven't changed.

I have absolutely no problem with the webforum as an _interface_ only. 
Make the core engine a news server with gated webfora and mailinglists,
and I'll be perfectly happy.
However, right now, most if not all webfora believe they are alone in
the universe, and behave as such.

----------------------------------------

	CALL FOR PAPERS

	Workshop on ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PLANNING and LEARNING (AIPL-07)

	Providence, Rhode Island, September 22, 2007
	(in conjunction with the International Conference on Automated  
Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS-07))

	Workshop Web Site: http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/ukuter/icaps07aipl/

Great strides have been made in automated AI Planning in recent  
years, including very efficient planning techniques that use  
controlled search with domain-specific and/or domain-independent  
heuristics, constraint-satisfaction techniques for reasoning with  
time and resources, and model-checking based planning algorithms. The  
effectiveness of these techniques has been demonstrated in the past  
International Planning Competitions, and to some extent, in real- 
world applications such as navigation tasks, space operations,  
railway control, and rescue-evacuation tasks.

One challenge for most planning systems is that they require a domain  
expert to provide some sort of ""planning knowledge"" to the system. In  
many realistic planning problems, however, such planning knowledge  
may not be completely available; this is partly because it is very  
hard to compile such knowledge due to the complexities in the  
domains, e.g., evacuation and rescue operations, and it is partly  
because there is no expert to provide it, e.g., space operations. In  
these complex domains, a planning system that can learn such  
knowledge to develop ways on how to operate in the world holds great  
promise to be successful.

There has been always an interest in research on developing new  
techniques in the intersection of AI Planning and Learning. Recently,  
the two communities have started to move towards each other in  
several venues. The biggest evidence for this trend is the recent  
projects initiated by the major funding agencies throughout the  
world; e.g., the DARPA Grand Challenge, the Integrated Learning and  
Transfer Learning programs at DARPA, and ""Dynamic Planning,  
Optimization, and Learning"" (DPOL) project at NICTA, Australia.

The aim of this workshop is to bring researchers together from the AI  
planning and machine learning communities. The tentative topics that  
will be covered in the workshop include, but are not limited to:
	* Theory of mixing inductive and deductive approaches to planning
	* Learning to search (e.g., learning search heuristics).
	* Learning for games (e.g., learning game evaluators at end games).
	* Generalizing plans across similar domains.
	* Function approximation in planning.
	* Learning models for planning.
	* (Relational) Reinforcement learning and planning.
	* Planning heuristics for exploration in reinforcement learning.
	* Optimization based approaches to planning.
	* Applications of planning and learning (e.g., methods applied in  
the past and present DARPA Grand Challenges)

Survival depends on splines, so you should install the splines library, and
then everything should be fine.

Dear Colleagues,

At the bottom of this message, you will find links to the 11th Edition of
Untangling the Web of  Antiretroviral price reductions, prepared by
Médecins Sans Frontières, Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines.  The
11th edition has been released at the AIDS conference in Mexico and is also
available on our website in 4 languages; English, Spanish. French and
Portuguese.

The Untangling the Web document was first published in response to the lack
of transparent and reliable information about prices of pharmaceutical
products on the international market. The purpose of the document is to
provide information to help purchasers make informed decisions when
purchasing ARVs. The report is a pricing guide and should not be viewed as
a manufacturers' price list.  In this 11th edition, all 22 U.S. FDA
approved ARVs are included.

Drug by drug, the report details the prices of ARVs quoted by both the
originator and generic manufacturers. Included is an analysis of the
evolution in the prices since the first edition. Key access issues for
developing countries, including specific comments on pediatrics, patents
and adaptability are highlighted for each product.

Today information on prices and access is more publically available and
continues to grow, so we are interested to understand how our document is
used and how we can make it better. Please help us make this as useful a
document as possible by filling out our readers' survey online.

Doctoral Consortium at the 8th EUROLAN Summer School - Semantics, Opinion and Sentiment in Text

http://eurolan.info.uaic.ro/2007/DC/

July 23 - August 3, 2007, Iasi, Romania

Doctoral Consortium - Call for Papers

Submission Deadline: May 7, 2007

1. General Information

The Doctoral Consortium at EUROLAN-2007 will provide an opportunity for graduate students (PhD and MSc heading towards PhD studies) investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing to present their current work and receive constructive feedback and guidance on future research, both from the general audience and the invited lecturers at the Summer School. 

The Doctoral Consortium will be held as a workshop during 3 or 4 consecutive evenings (1.5 hour slots) in one of the two weeks of the EUROLAN 2007 Summer School. The final version of the accepted papers will be published in the Proceedings of the EUROLAN 2007 Doctoral Consortium. During the Summer School the students will present their work, will receive constructive comments wrt. to current and future research directions from a panel of established researchers, and will benefit from the collaborative climate established among all participants, thus enhancing future joint work among them. Students will also prepare a poster which will be on display throughout the Summer School. 

We invite all interested graduate students to submit their work to the Consortium. As the main goal of the Consortium is for the authors to receive feedback, the emphasis is on work in progress.

The research being presented can be from any topic area within Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing, however students working in the areas related with the theme of this year's Summer School like:
- computational semantics, 
- ontology enriched NLP applications
- opinion and sentiment analysis, 
- role of  sentiment analysis in multimodal human computer interaction 
are particularly encouraged to submit their work.

Well-known researchers from these areas will be invited lectures of the school and therefore available for interesting discussions.

2. Submission Requirements

The submissions should describe original work, still in progress. The submissions may have more than one author; however, all of them MUST be students. 
The paper should include: 
- the problem(s) that the proposed research is addressing;
- the main contribution(s) of the research to the CL & NLP field; 
- the proposed solution(s), including a brief description of the methodology adopted;
- the future research plan. 


3. Submission Procedure

Submission must be electronic. The following formats are acceptable: PDF (.pdf), PostScript (.ps), Rich Text Format (.rtf), Microsoft Word (.doc). Submissions should not exceed 8 pages, including references and annexes and should follow the Springer format, soon available as a .dot template on the web page of the event. The papers will be uploaded on a special page, to be announced on the web page of the Doctoral Consortium.

4. Important Dates

Paper submissions deadline: *May 7, 2007*
Notification of acceptance: May 28, 2007
Camera ready papers due: June 18, 2007

You are right, that wasn't worded properly.  I think it is much more like:
Power of a theory = number of things it explains / (number * ""size"" of 
things it needs to assume )
Where size is exponentially proportional to how much ""faith"" vs. 
testable fact is involved.

In other words:
Power of a theory = number of things it explains / (number of things it 
needs to assume * how much of a leap of faith those are)
God is an infinite leap of faith.  You do the math.

I have a huge text file (1.7 million lines) full of unicode and ascii
text (half and half).

note: disk space for copies is not a problem, if I need to manipulate this file

Also, I have a 30 line file full of ascii text.

I need to search the large file for any occurrences of the keywords in
the 30 line file.

Ignoring the unicode issue, I could use grep (of fgrep, egrep) with
appropriate args.

I have no idea how to handle the unicode issue.

Any suggestions?

Thanks

As far as I can tell, the assignment of perl_root is irrelevant, or
at least is not the first problem we trip over.  The problem is that
we're putting a garbage path at the beginning of @INC.  With
blead@32219 I see this:

ok 8 - Extracting module to D0:[CRAIG.PERL.LIB.CPANPLUS.T.dummy-cpanplus.5_10_0.build.Foo-Bar-0_01]

I'll  try to hunt down later where that bogus path gets constructed.

When I looked at   what I sent the first line was present and correct - If I pick off the mailbox part of all addresses after the 0x81   byte I get:   ""Can you point me to a good regex tutorial?

It was in conf.pl, but it was the fact that paths were being
explicitly joined with colons rather than $Config{path_sep} before
populating $ENV{PATH}.  I would have expected that to wreak havoc on
Win32 as well as VMS.

The attached fixes that and a number of other things.  We're down to
the following in 02_CPANPLUS-Dist-Build.t as the only remaining
CPANPLUS failure on VMS:

ok 14 -    Status says module installed
not ok 15 - Found packlist
#   Failed test 'Found packlist'
#   at [-.lib.cpanplus.dist.build.t]02_cpanplus-dist-build.t line 173.
not ok 16 - Packlist contains entries
#   Failed test 'Packlist contains entries'
#   at [-.lib.cpanplus.dist.build.t]02_cpanplus-dist-build.t line 176.
ok 17 - Uninstalling module

The .packlist file is in the architecture-specific auto directory,
but that directory is not in @INC so it doesn't look there so of
course it doesn't find it.  Not sure yet if the problem is in
Module::Build or CPANPLUS or just the way the test is set up.

My recent upgrade went smooth and slick. Lots of visual upgrades and

In other words, you don't know what a network block device is

If it makes you feel any better, it only runs on the loopback device, you're 
not creating a new network *device*, you're starting a network *service*, and 
this service, as I said, only runs on the lo device

Hey Joe,

Actually that's one of my problems too. Let's say not playing games with 
OpenGL ;-) (public mailing list, you know) but for example Google Earth is 
impossible to run.

When working I'm pretty fine with the standart desktop with couple of 
modifications.

Assuming we are discussing the output of str() rather that repr(),

Oceanographic Laboratory

Topic: Applying Rule-Based Models to Sea Level Forecasting

Supervisors: Jonathan Lawry (University of Bristol), Kevin Horsburgh 
(Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory)

Project Details ()

Storm surges are the response of the sea surface to the meteorological 
forces of wind and atmospheric pressure. They represent an important 
component of total sea level and have been the subject of much scientific 
investigation. Marine scientists and engineers need to understand the 
statistics of surge occurrence and tide-surge interaction over long 
timescales in order to provide estimates of extreme sea level for design 
purposes. Numerical models of tides and surges (based on hydrodynamic 
equations) have a long history in coastal flood warning. Whilst these 
models have been very successful, and form the backbone of current 
operational forecast procedures, they are inherently limited by 
inaccuracies in bathymetry, meteorological forcing and parameterisations of 
sub-grid scale processes. There are now real opportunities for alternative, 
data-driven methods of surge prediction using artificial intelligence (AI) 
and in particular rule-based models (RBMs). RBMs can provide a high-level 
linguistic representation of the mapping between input and output variables 
in a prediction problem, allowing for more understandable models which give 
an insight into important underlying relationships. Such models can also be 
extended to incorporate both the fuzzy and probabilistic uncertainty 
typically present in hydrology and oceanography applications. This PhD will 
allow the student to demonstrate the use of rule-based models to an 
important environmental problem.

 The student will develop rule-based models combining probabilistic and 
fuzzy uncertainty and compare these with both deterministic forecasting 
techniques and alternative time series methods. The student will apply and 
extend techniques such as the LID3 algorithm for learning probability 
estimation trees incorporating fuzzy description labels. The new models 
will then be applied to the improvement of tidal forecasts in regions of 
extreme tidal range, and to the prediction of storm surges at key sites 
around the UK. The models will also be used to examine the principal 
physical causes of extreme sea level events, and the logical rules 
governing tide-surge interaction.  Finally, the project will demonstrate 
the possibility of using artificial intelligence for the interpretation of 
ensemble forecasts.

The successful applicant will have a good numerical degree in mathematics, 
statistics, computer science, engineering or physical science. Some 
knowledge of artificial intelligence, probability theory and fuzzy logic 
would be an advantage, although full training will be given. The student 
will be provided with training in coastal oceanography and numerical 
modelling. All necessary data from tide gauges and from the deterministic 
numerical models will be supplied by POL and the Met Office.

Funding

This project is funded by the EPSRC Flood Risk Management Consortium. This 
position is open to anyone, but non-EU candidates must find alternative 
means to fund the difference between UK and overseas tuition fees.

Please contact either Jonathan Lawry or Kevin Horsburgh directly for any 
informal inquires. The Closing date for applications is 30 June.

    THE FOURTH BAYESIAN MODELLING APPLICATIONS WORKSHOP
                     DURING UAI-06

                CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS
                    July 13th, 2006
                   Cambridge, MA, USA

       Special Theme:  Bayesian models meet Cognition

      Submission of contributions due: April 21st, 2006
    Enquiries and submissions to: uai-workshop AT cs.uu.nl


************************************************************


GOAL
----

As in the previous years, the goal of the workshop is to provide
a focused, informal forum for a fruitful exchange of research
questions and insights, of experiences, and of methodologies and
techniques among theorists, practitioners and tool developers in
the application of Bayesian models to a wide range of application
areas.  As an additional avenue of exchange, eligible contributions
will be compiled into proceedings in addition to the overall
conference publication.  Based on the response at the workshop,
papers will be selected for later publication in a special handbook
or journal issue.


SPECIAL TOPIC AREA
------------------

This year we are especially encouraging contributions that address
our special theme

  ""Bayesian models meet Cognition""

In particular, we are looking for papers that focus on issues in
the application of Bayesian models that involve human factors.
Examples include, but are not restricted to, the following issues.

In the construction of a Bayesian model, often both its graphical
structure and its associated numerical parameters are acquired from
human experts.  For this purpose, dedicated elicitation techniques
are being designed.  Do these techniques forestall, for example,
biases and over-commitments of the resulting model?  Are these
techniques easy to use, taking relatively little time on the part
of the experts?  Do the techniques scale up to building large
models?  How can knowledge obtained from multiple experts be
combined?  How can experts be involved in assessing the quality of
the resulting model?

Bayesian models usually are developed with a ""real world"" setting in
mind and are tailored to this setting.  The model will be consulted
by users who have to enter data, to understand the output, to assess
the validity and robustness of the output, and to receive support in
their reasoning and decision-making processes.  How can data entry be
organised and supported, to allow for easy use of the model?  How can
the output of the model be presented to the user, to allow for easy
and correct interpretation?  How can the output of the model be
explained to the user?  How can the model support ""what-if"" reasoning
processes?


GENERAL FOCUS
-------------

The emphasis of this year's workshop is on cognitive issues that
have to be addressed when developing and using Bayesian models.  We
are encouraging submissions that address fundamental issues, present
concrete solutions, describe experiments, or analyse open problems,
within a broad range of application areas involving diagnosis,
optimisation, temporal reasoning, spatial reasoning, and forecasting.

In addition to submissions addressing human factors, we also welcome
contributions to the overall focus of Bayesian modelling.  Submissions
addressing novel applications are particularly encouraged.


FORMAT
------

The workshop will take place on Thursday, July 13th, the day of the
UAI tutorials.  The workshop will begin with each participant giving
a short introduction to themselves and their work.  These brief
introductions will be followed by sessions devoted to cognitive
issues in developing and using Bayesian models, consisting of
presentations and open discussions.  We will conclude with a plenary
panel discussion which will sum up the days activities and talk about
possible plans for next year.


ARRANGEMENTS
------------

The workshop will run on the premises of the general UAI conference.
A registration fee for the workshop will be required in addition to
the main conference registration.


TO CONTRIBUTE
-------------

Persons desiring to contribute should prepare a contribution (3 - 8
pages, preferrably in the same format as for the overall conference)
and a short statement of interest, explaining their background, the
applications in which they have contributed and the characteristics
of the domain in which they work.  The contribution should raise
questions and offer results, which the participant can speak about.
All participants will be expected to have material to present for
the workshop.  Participants are encouraged to apply jointly with
members of other disciplines with whom they have collaborated.  Make
all submissions and enquires to uai-workshop AT cs.uu.nl.

Participation will be limited to 30 individuals.  All members of the
workshop committee who would like to attend are expected to qualify as
participants.  Selection will be done by the committee's decision of
the mix of individuals who are likely to generate the most constructive
presentations and discussions.

Excellent! For what it's worth, hg clone took 5 minutes on my PC (with
broadband access). That's faster than simply downloading the Bazaar
shared repository tarball (which took 13 minutes)!

Are you keeping the mirror updated with respect to Subversion?

I don't want to start a comparison at this point, but as neither
system offers downloading of truncated history at the moment, the
speed to grab a new clone of the full repository is likely to be
pretty important.

My understanding was that the pybsddb copy in Python *is* the official
code base. I think it's unfortunate that the pybsddb project was
revived, even though it was already dead.

Perhaps we should remove bsddb from Python again, and refer people to
pybsddb instead?

The usual solution is to not integrate then, at all. Python doesn't
really ship with any libraries that also have an active life outside
of Python.

Deprecation takes one major release.  We support the current major release 
(and possibly the previous major release for critical bugs only).

Right.

I'm not sure any more of that can work in real life.

I can imagine creating a mailing list for critical update notifications, but 
hold little hope for support from downstream unless the packager happens to 
be a contributing member of the project.

Is this mainly a request to use more open source tools?  Because if
the concern is just cost, Python 2.6 and 3.0 compile with the free
Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Express editions.

The attached patch (which supercedes my previous patches on
the matter) fixes the above problem for 'abs' and 'neg'
overloading.  I added more tests as well.

The patch can be check using the following:

/perl -Ilib -lwe '{ package t0; sub mynum { -36028797018963971 } use
overload ""0+"" => \\&mynum, fallback => 1; } printf ""%d\\n"",

Why?
I added documentation for the current way. I was not aware of the other
thread's mention of this issue. When your patch goes in --and looking at it
it makes sense to me-- I can easily adjust the documentation to reflect the
new state. :)

I can understand your apparent frustration at not having gotten someone to
look over your issue, but please: relax. I cannot make source changes, only
documentation.

Worthy goals and some good observations.  The folks who have built
File::Spec over the years are no slouches, and I think what you're
proposing is harder than it looks.  But it is harder to pick apart and
reassemble file specs portably than it ought to be (not that any other
language I'm aware of even tries), so count me in, but after 5.10.

Karmic Love Reading



When it comes to romance, have you been naughty or nice? Find out with a free sample Karmic Love Reading from Astrology.com.







































Your emotions are like glue. You're stuck in one mood, then another. It has nothing to do with your packmates or your humans; it has everything to do with subliminal heavy business.

			  










              You have nothing but deep emotions. What other kinds of feelings are there? Well, you could care just a little or have a pacing fancy for a change, instead of being passionate and jealous.










              Your human is ignoring their health. Is it willful disobedience? Who knows? But it's on you to enforce the exercise quota, if only for your own good.










              Indecision is foreign to you, so when you feel a bit confused, it should stop you in your tracks. Don't get involved in anything you are unsure of, even if it has only a whiff of intensity.










              You understand what's beneath the surface. That's what comes from your lack of language. So with their opposing thumbs and fancy grammar, humans can't grasp what you know intuitively. It's on you.










              A pocket is not a shield. You can tell its contents without having to see it. Getting the treat you know is there is not an unrealistic goal, so keep up the begging until they relent.

















ADVERTISEMENT












              Everyone at the dog park has the same issues, all revolving around material possessions. You'd all have a lot more fun and avoid the fights if you left your toys at home today.










              If people can't help but pet you, then you can't help but react. You'll be kept on a short leash, though, if you keep it up, while they'll still have their freedom. Give that some thought before each walk.










              Feeling bored? Put your active subconscious to good use. You can find intruders in shadows so don't lean on the mailman for all of your entertainment. Simply fit their arrival into the bigger picture.










              Don't stay detached from your fellow dogs. Organizing is your birth right, so either join in an existing pack or rope in others. Once you have that network of friends, you'll understand how helpful it is.










              Other dogs have deep feelings for you. You make the dog park come alive just by entering its gates. If that's not enough of a reason to feel socially useful, think of the good you do your owner.










              There is nothing wishy-washy about it. The dog run is like a blender and no one can escape getting sucked into it. Once you're in, it's like swimming with sharks, albeit through something thicker than water.

In point of fact, for an *end user* it makes increasing sense to use 
application installers that automatically install a correct-version 
interpreter and all dependencies in a stand-alone manner (i.e. 
explicitly *not* sharing anything with any other installed application.

This makes uninstall much easier, as the lack of external dependencies 
eases version lock-step problems.

It would pain me, as a computer scientist, to do this, but I honestly 
believe it may be the way forward -- just think, it wouldn't even matter 
whether an application (and all its extension modules) had been built 
with VS2003, VS2008 or Mingw.

People misunderstood when Mike Driscoll started to provide pure-Python 
modules as Windows installers, but increasingly your naive Windows 
programmer is going to be happier doing that. I'm not sure whether that 
provides easy_f**king_uninstall (Zed Shaw will live on in my memory for 
that particular PyCon moment), but it (ought to be) relatively easy to 
do so. Extension modules for programmers still offer more of a 
challenge, but a build-farm for extension module writers could help there.

As someone who just gave away a Windows laptop because I'd become sick 
of the sight of it I sing amen to that.

I quite agree. I believe it might help if we clearly distinguished 
between ""developer install"", to add required functionality to a specific 
Python installation (and here distutils is almost good enough, 
setuptools begins to seem like overkill), and ""application install"" to 
add a bundle of executable functionality to a computer for an end-user.

We need to stop protesting that our installation tools are easy enough 
and try to get behind the various platforms, be it with Windows 
installers, rpms, or other support. We probably aren't doing this 
because it's work nobody particularly relishes, and has relatively low 
visibility in the developer world. Non-developer Python programmers and 
end-users would thank us, though.

  Steve

It appears that Perl is loading Carp/Heavy just in case an error might 
occur, and not because an error occurred.

I have put all sorts of debug statements around where the Carp/Heavy 
failure is showing up, and while apparently the module is loaded, there 
is no failure, so the warning routine is never called.

Someone who understands Perl internals better than I do may have an 
explanation as to why that is.

No reason.  In my tests, @INC contains ('../lib') before the first 
shift, and ('../lib','../lib') after the shift, so the prior values are 
not used.

I just discovered that t/op/taint.t is mangling PATH and DCL$PATH when 
it is run outside of the test harness, which breaks other things.

Hi.  Most likely this is a case of overfitting (overtraining):  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting): ""especially in cases where  learning was performed too long or where training examples are rare, the  learner may adjust to very specific random features of the training data,  that have no causal relation to the target function.""  Overfitting in back-propagation neural networks like MLP (resulting in  prediction bias toward one/some of the target classes) can be caused by the  following: if misclassified training instances continue to be misclassified  iteration after iteration, they get overweighted and actually take weight  from the correctly classified instances, i.e. the weights become  imbalanced. Furthermore, if misclassified instances happen to be clearly  concentrated to some classes, this can result in confusion matrix that you  quoted (zero correct instances for some classes).  > I have not found a pattern in the parameters that causes this.  MLP describes the parameters as follows: ""learningRate -- The amount the  weights are updated. momentum -- Momentum applied to the weights during  updating. decay -- This will cause the learning rate to decrease. This will  divide the starting learning rate by the epoch number, to determine what  the current learning rate should be. This may help to stop the network from  diverging from the target output, as well as improve general performance.""  As far as I know, no off-the-shelf formula exists for optimizing these  parameters. It is an interchange of parameters and the dataset. If you are  looking for a pattern in performance, consider that the parameters operate  together (learning rate * momentum / decay) so that the first two operate  for controlling speed of change and the latter for stopping the change.  ""Ultimately, the cost function will depend on the task we wish to perform.""  (wiki). If you are getting as high as > 85% accuracies from most  configurations, this suggests that optimal training model for this dataset  is produced when the parameters are set on 'fast burn' (few iterations) so  I would say higher learning rate * momentum and fast decay work best (do  they?).

The dependency on gtk is unnecessary and means it can effectively only  
be run on Linux.  Specifically it means I can't do releases on OS X.   
I don't see much benefit in having a gui tool for doing releases.

Some of the problems I had include having to run glade3 in order to  
update the menus which allow you to choose which release you were  
going to make.  It only new about py24 and 25 maintenance.  No knock  
on Anthony there, since those are the releases he had to make, but I  
shouldn't have to edit the interface description files to add new  
release versions.

Also, the scheme to compare IDLE versions seemed way off.  Maybe  
that's another thing that makes sense for py24 and py25 but it  
definitely didn't work for py30.

The much more serious problem, and where I stopped, is that welease  
broke on code containing the with statement.  I don't remember the  
details because at that point I was pretty tired and hadn't made any  
progress on the releases, but I /think/ the problem is that welease  
runs on a different version of Python than it's checking so it can't  
handle syntactic differences and such.

The kind of tool I think we need is a fairly straightforward command  
line tool, but one that would not just check that things are done, but  
also do them.  E.g. the tool would keep track of all the little places  
where version numbers and copyright years need updating.  The tool  
would actually make those changes, and using $EDITOR would show them  
to you for confirmation.  It would pause at steps that require  
coordination, such as when things need to be committed or signed, or  
when you're waiting from input from others.  It would have a dry-run  
mode and it would fairly closely follow PEP 101.

Anyway, that's the kind of tool I plan on building (or perhaps with  
help from others -- hi Benjamin) for the next alpha round.

Cheers,
- -Barry

                 UK ISPs to Spy on Google Users (and Others)

                http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000375.html


Greetings.  Given the CCTV surveillance fetish in the UK these days,
it seems somehow sickly appropriate that British ISPs are in the
forefront when it comes to spying on the content of their
subscribers' Web browsing -- and it appears that Google users are in
the bull's-eye.

Most of the related media attention so far has revolved around the
manner in which the three largest UK ISPs have gone to bed with
""Phorm"" -- toward the goal of monetizing Web browsing habits of
subscribers and providing targeted ads
( http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/29/phorm_roundup/ ).

Of course, there's a lot ""soothing"" promotional blather on the BT
site claiming that the data collected regarding the sites that you
visit is quickly deleted or anonymized.  And while officially the
ISPs claim that they haven't made a decision about opt-out vs.
opt-in, the current British Telecom limited deployment -- they call the
""service"" ""Webwise"" ( http://webwise.bt.com/webwise/index.html )
and promote it as mainly an anti-phishing system -- appears to be
opt-out (requiring either maintaining a special cookie in your
browser or blocking all cookies from a particular site).

Third-party tracking of the Web sites that you visit is bad enough,
but Webwise (and presumably the other incarnations of the Phorm
system) go one big step farther -- they actually *spy* on your
Web content and extract for their own use the search terms that you
enter into search engines:

   ""We [Webwise] use the website address, keywords and search terms
    from the page viewed to match a category or area of interest
    (e.g., travel or finance).""

Given that the vast majority of searches these days are conducted
with Google, it's obvious that this ISP-based system will be
attempting to monetize the vast number of search transactions
between users and Google, in a technical manner that seems eerily
similar to wiretapping.

This is unbelievably intrusive and unacceptable, except perhaps on a
fully-informed opt-in basis.  When I use a search engine -- let's
say Google -- I am expressing an implicit belief that my search data
will not be abused or misused by Google.  I have made no such
determinations regarding any use in any manner of this search query
data by ISPs or their partners. 

I'm communicating with Google.  Period.  I don't care if the ISPs
claim that the data is quickly discarded, or anonymized so well that
it looks like an iPhone that's been put through a blender 
( http://youtube.com/watch?v=qg1ckCkm8YI ), nobody but Google and I
have any rights to those search terms!

And we all know that search keywords can be very sensitive.  Names,
addresses, social security numbers (sloppy, but people do it),
searches for new words to be used for domains or product names --
all manner of personally and commercially sensitive information can
be found in search query data.  

Anyone who tried this stunt on such a basis with physical mail or
phone calls they'd probably land in prison.  But ISPs are
increasingly pushing the envelope in terms of spying on and even
altering subscriber Web traffic.  This latest example is utterly
beyond the pale, and it's hard to see how such abusive behavior can
continue to pass legal muster indefinitely.

If subscribers wish to opt-in to such systems with a full
understanding of what's involved -- well, I wouldn't recommend it
but that's their choice.  However, if these systems are fully
deployed in a manner that requires subscribers to opt-out to avoid
having their communications with Google and other search engines
being intercepted, then I foresee some very angry subscribers, and a
particular search services giant who will likely be anything but
amused.

Once again:  - The Bios has to reserve address space for PCI devices and usually     reserves between 0.5 and 1 GiB.  - To make the physical RAM that's hidden by that reservation     available, most BIOSs map this RAM beyond the 4 GiB (2^32)    Threshold. - To address that memory, you need a kernel supporting either    PAE or long (i.e. 64 bit) mode. If the memory isn't available, it's rather obvious that it is the BIOS that failed to do the mapping. >In PAE the operating system uses page tables to map this 4 GiB >address space onto the 64 GiB of total memory, and the map is >usually different for each process. You've got something mixed up there. Not the OS but the processor uses page tables and it does that for *all* operating modes, not only PAE, as virtual memory management on x86 and x86-64 relies on page tables.

Remember, this is predominately about anonymous vs non-anonymous  transactions and systems have always treaty anonymous and non-anonymous  transactions differently. An anonymous back door is the last thing we want, although this strongly  appears what the ASP model is promoting. :-) --  Sincerely Hector Santos, CTO http://www.santronics.com http://santronics.blogspot.com ------------------------------ _______________________________________________ NOTE WELL: This list operates according to",0,1

At times our network is quite slow, so to prevent blocking of my main
application, I decided to put the code into a separate thread.

Depending on the network speed, it can take up to 30 seconds to return.
This is because of a vpn connection etc.

But when put in a separate thread, it will block the entire application
until the function returns. Take the following code for example:

import threading, time, os, win32api

file = r""\\\\network_share\\file.exe""

def get_version_number():
	if os.path.exists(file):
		info = win32api.GetFileVersionInfo(file, ""\\\\"")
		ms = info['FileVersionMS']
		ls = info['FileVersionLS']
		return win32api.HIWORD(ms), win32api.LOWORD(ms),
win32api.HIWORD(ls), win32api.LOWORD(ls)
		
def test():

print ""AA""
threading.Thread(target=test).start()

In the one case I'm aware of (File::Find) it is the module itself
rather than the test for it that uses dynamic loading, or, rather,
uses a module -- Carp -- that itself uses dynamic loading.

I don't particularly like it either, and I don't think it's a
VMS-specific issue, but I'm not sure what else to suggest.  The
deadly combination is changing directories at run-time, having
everything in @INC a relative path (such as when testing an
uninstalled perl with t/TEST), and invoking a module that uses
dynamic loading.  When File::Find attempts to carp about something
while running its tests, the only user-visible problem is:

Can't locate Carp/Heavy.pm in @INC (@INC contains: ../lib ../lib) at ../lib/warnings.pm line 450.

As far as I can tell, the only way in which this is a VMS problem is
that we're the only ones triggering a warning.  Perhaps for now we
should have the File::Find tests put an absolute path in @INC and
leave TestInit alone, though there are other modules, such as
File::Path, that chdir all over the place and also use Carp.

RMS is just a formula, you can apply it to any waveform. However, applied 
to power doesn't make sense, because the square is always positive, and 
power in a non resistive circuit will be both positive and negative at 
times, reducing the ""really"" used power even to zero.

Thus RMS power makes no sense, although it is calculable.

If not it would be a bug in pycentral/pysupport.  Only two bugs to

Again, that would be a bug in CDBS.

For the specific snippet you showed, yes that does essentially
""pythonX.Y setup.py --root=$some_alternate_root"" as I said above.  As
an aside I also happen to be in the camp that dislikes CDBS...


The specifics and complications don't matter for this discussion I
think.  If setup.py installs the correct file into the installdb then
it will work in almost all cases, Neal Becker confirmed this is true
for Fedora as well.

Protocol   bridging could become problematic when email is not supported natively   by the transmitting domain.  Of course, this also creates problems   with respect to DSNs as well.  Ignoring the problem of DSNs, mandating   support of SMTP when accepting an SMTP message bridged from a   different transport would be rather problematic when SMTP is not also   supported.  However, accepting such messages into an SMTP represents a   choice that opens up an avenue likely to permit abuse.  So this   concern seems somewhat ill founded. Determining support of the relevant transport protocol could have been   generally stated as using the absence of the protocol discovery   record, (MX in the case of SMTP) in conjunction with the presence of   the DKIM policy record.  This offered a means to indicate the support   of a specific protocol, and if not supported, a means to truncate the   policy discovery process and subsequent validation transactions.  This   would have better protected existing domains that are not involved in   email from the traffic generated by spoofed messages.  In addition,   this would have offered extremely strong refutation of fraudulent   messages made against any existing domain.  Strong evidence is a good   thing in general. To settle the issue as to what protocol is covered by a DKIM policy,   Jim suggested a policy scope tag instead.  This would permit domains   to indicate which transport protocols have implemented DKIM and to   signal when DKIM policy can be applied.  For gateways into SMTP, a   means to disavow support of a transport protocol could be important as   a means to better limit avenues of abuse.  In any case, any message   bridged over into SMTP is likely find SMTP policy applied, and IMHO,   that can't be helped.  With a protocol scope parameter, DKIM policy   could then do for IM, what it did for SMTP.  Abuse is not just limited   to SMTP. The ability to clearly indicate whether any message is fraudulent   without incurring additional transactions is also important from a   general domain protection standpoint.  Jim is right.  Policy can be   made to include scope, and that also offers a more flexible and   workable solution.  Message abuse will demand negotiated changes   accommodated to some extent by policy assertions.  Keeping a lid on   the the added overhead represents the remaining challenged. -Doug           ------------------------------ >From mwbfbfl@santronics.com  Sun Feb 24 10:31:33 2008 Message: 3 Date: Sat, 16 Feb 2008 02:05:17 -0500 From: Hector Santos  Subject: Re: [ietf-dkim] Re: ISSUE 1547: SSP-02: MX Record publishing 	mandateto	reduce DNS overhead for SSP Discovery and to 	detectfraudulent messages To: Douglas Otis  Cc: DKIM List ,	""MH Michael Hammer \\(5304\\)"" 	 Message-ID: <47B68B2D.8020705@santronics.com> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed Douglas Otis wrote: >  > On Feb 15, 2008, at 3:49 PM, Damon wrote: >  >> Just in case we need a tie breaker... -1 >  > To summarize, as a bunch of -1 says so little, ...

Doug, for the record, I was more against the MX lookup MUST in the SSP  record discovery setup.   IMO, I prefer it to be a MAY or even a SHOULD  only because historically it was not a requirement and therefore highly  possible that the MX did not exist. Keep in mind the steps in SSP is only a recommendation. As long as the  end result is the same, people don't have to follow those steps. It is  very possible the MX lookup was already been done in other places. Look at this way, the way I view it, if we keep the MUST MX lookup  requirement for the SSP discovery steps, then +1, I would agree there  should also be a MUST for adding/having a MX record for any x822.From  domain used in a domain's new DKIM signing mail operations. So I have less of a problem with the idea from a general DKIM deployment  recommendation for domains to consider and even possibly a SHOULD  recommendation for having an MX record for x822.From from the standpoint  of ""DKIM/SSP protocol consistency"" especially when it differs from the  return path or sender domains. > The ability to clearly indicate whether any message is fraudulent  > without incurring additional transactions is also important from a  > general domain protection standpoint.

This is a very important part (for me) in the  implementation considerations. But consider, before you can mandate an x822.From MX with a MUST, you  also have to, at the very least, allow for verifier policy based  handling and that has been removed in the current emasculated model. Since policies allowed implementators to optimize and scale DKIM  processing, its removal reduces the MDA adoption incentive for DKIM  verification. Thus, with little to no payoff resulting from the  additional overhead, there is less reason to even bother with the  overhead. --  Sincerely Hector Santos, CTO http://www.santronics.com http://santronics.blogspot.com ------------------------------ >From udcat@mail-abuse.org  Sun Feb 24 10:31:33 2008 Message: 4 Date: Sat, 16 Feb 2008 05:20:15 -0800 From: Douglas Otis  Subject: Re: [ietf-dkim] Re: ISSUE 1547: SSP-02: MX Record publishing 	mandateto reduce DNS overhead for SSP Discovery and to 	detectfraudulent messages To: Hector Santos  Cc: DKIM List ,	""MH Michael Hammer \\(5304\\)"" 	 Message-ID:  Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed; delsp=yes On Feb 15, 2008, at 11:05 PM, Hector Santos wrote: > Douglas Otis wrote: >> On Feb 15, 2008, at 3:49 PM, Damon wrote: >>> Just in case we need a tie breaker... -1 >> To summarize, as a bunch of -1 says so little, ... > > I know, don't you hate that. :-)  I call it the ""Follow the   > Chieftain Syndrome""   In my opinion, if ""votes"" came with some   > reason or explanation for the position, it might help sway others. > >> .... the push back generated by this concept had to do with DKIM   >> policy being applicable to other transport protocols that might be   >> bridged into SMTP. > > Doug, for the record, I was more against the MX lookup MUST in the   > SSP record discovery setup.

While the horse died before leaving the barn, the MX mandate   (discovery record) would have been imposed only on domains that:   1) implemented DKIM and   2) published a DKIM policy record. This scheme did not impact domains not publishing DKIM policy   records.  You are correct, MX record may never be published in some   cases, but it would be nice to impose a simple limitation on domain   tree walking for polices. By mandating that a discovery record (MX in the case of SMTP) be   published along with policy records, just the existence of these two   records provides a means to detect fraudulent use of a domain without   examining record content.  This approach tolerates policy record   format changes, while still safely minimizing the impact of a daily   onslaught of spoofed references to existing domains that do not even   handle messages.  The mandate would have offered a means to squelch a   series of policy and key transactions in such cases.  An invalid   signature may occur for many reasons, which leaves this result   category significantly weaker than finding a domain publishing a   policy record without also publishing a discovery record. Technically, this approach creates a problem when the domain uses DKIM   and publishes the policy record, but then does not support SMTP.  When   their messages are converted by a protocol gateway to SMTP, a policy/  discovery record check would detect SMTP is not supported.  While the   return path instantiated by the protocol gateway could provide a   conversion for DSNs, the domain of the return path would be unrelated   to the DKIM signature.  So yes, while this might be seen as a   disadvantage, it also closes an avenue for abuse not controlled by   DKIM.  This limitation would induce an assurance of a direct return   path or the domain would be indicating they don't want a protocol   translation.  This gives the originating domain greater control, where   dummy records might be published to achieve the desired effect. > Keep in mind the steps in SSP is only a recommendation.

An MX (or some record) was to be queried when a policy record is not   found to check the existence of the domain.  If an MX record had been   accessed recently, then it could be in the cache.  Had there been a   mandate to publish policy and discovery records together, then there   would be a greater advantage in checking the MX record. > Look at this way, the way I view it, if we keep the MUST MX lookup   > requirement for the SSP discovery steps, then +1, I would agree   > there should also be a MUST for adding/having a MX record for any   > x822.From domain used in a domain's new DKIM signing mail operations. The logic would be the other way around, but it would seem the WG   wishes to keep all options open.  By adding scope to the policy   record, the same effect is possible with somewhat larger policy records. > So I have less of a problem with the idea from a general DKIM   > deployment recommendation for domains to consider and even possibly   > a SHOULD recommendation for having an MX record for x822.From from   > the standpoint of ""DKIM/SSP protocol consistency"" especially when it   > differs from the return path or sender domains.

By pairing policy/discovery records, the content of the policy record   does not matter in preventing the spoofing of existent domains that do   not support SMTP.  On the other hand, the term ""discardable"" instead   of ""strict"", ""sole"", or ""exclusive"" or words to that effect, means   transactional domains wishing to thwart spoofing are instead likely to   find too much of their communications lost.  It will take some time   for signature integrity to mature.  This problem is not just due to   mailing-lists.  The ""discardable"" term will likely ensure the needed   level of integrity never occurs.  Much of the essential feedback on   whether the domain is being spoofed, or whether there is a signature   integrity problem is likely to be lost. > Since policies allowed implementators to optimize and scale DKIM   > processing, its removal reduces the MDA adoption incentive for DKIM   > verification.

DKIM has value at the MUA where scaling and overhead is much less of a   problem.  The triage process at the MTA could be guided by policy   assertions.  DKIM validation at the MTA may be limited to domains with   a history of being targeted by abuse.  When these domains are   unwilling to make signature assurances, filtering must be relaxed to   reduce the rate of false positives.  In this regard, there appears to   be agreement SSP-01 was a better in that respect.  There does not seem   to be a problem when signatures are added by third-parties however,   while admitting to not understanding all of that thread. -Doug ------------------------------ >From mwbfbfl@santronics.com  Sun Feb 24 10:31:33 2008 Message: 5 Date: Sat, 16 Feb 2008 11:24:06 -0500 From: Hector Santos  Subject: Re: [ietf-dkim] Re: ISSUE 1547: SSP-02: MX Record publishing 	mandateto	reduce DNS overhead for SSP Discovery and to 	detectfraudulent messages To: Douglas Otis  Cc: DKIM List ,	""MH Michael Hammer \\(5304\\)"" 	 Message-ID: <47B70E26.10105@santronics.com> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed Douglas Otis wrote: > Technically, this approach creates a problem when the domain uses DKIM  > and publishes the policy record, but then does not support SMTP.   Well, I saw that thread. My input: Since the 80s we had multi-mail  format networking/gateway products that has served millions over the  course of that time. I think we have a pretty good idea of the practical  aspects of it.  Primarily, the idea of attempting to obtain gateway  perfection and persistent mail integrity, DKIM or not, during  transformation processes is expecting a bit much. :-) This is just a small part, but on our system, we have a major framework  user option:       Preserve MIME: Yes/No Preserving MIME tells our gateway to import and save mail in raw (as is)  or save it in our local proprietary format (text with separated  attachments).  Preserving MIME has only become important over the years  as our customers as their user's began to use offline readers more, e.g.  POP3 and News Readers.   As the era of HTML mail is more acceptable,  that is another reason users are turning on this option.   But there are  customers, for security reasons, who don't even offer the option to  their users and save the user's mail in our native format.  This is  important when it comes the type of MUA question. Keep focus. DKIM is for a x822 mail system and IMV regardless of how  x822 mail is sent, moved, gated, transformed, and re-transformed, it  still has to be a x822 system when it finally gets to where ever.  > When  > their messages are converted by a protocol gateway to SMTP, a  > policy/discovery record check would detect SMTP is not supported. I think if you are proposing a method for a domain to declare a policy  that says:    ""Do not expect any mail purported to be from me to originate     from a QWK, Fidonet, NEWS (NNTP) or XYZ protocol posted system"" while it sounds like a good idea, I think it is an overkill and I  believe you can the same benefits by using policies that restrict 3rd  party signatures. > DKIM has value at the MUA where scaling and overhead is much less of a  > problem.   It depends. What kind of MUA are you referring to?  Online or Offline? You see, some vendors have to deal with design implementations for many    mail reading device methods, online and offline.   An Offline MUA has  different considerations than an Online MUA. Should we ignore DKIM for users who want to pickup their mail via POP3?  and just think about the online users? I think a good reason for the chaotic discussions here is that we  subjective product designs that is imposing their own feature list on  everyone else!! We should instead focus on the functional and logical points of the  fundamental protocol and let implementators decide how it best fits  their product lines.  Instead we get people mandating you can't do this  or that, which might be ok, if it made sense and had considerations for  the general case of systems out there. It really isn't that hard.  Either you sign or you don't.  That idea is  vendor product independent.  All I want to know is what the domain  intended and expected when we are asked to begin looking at this new  level of mail information.         ""ok, I looked, I see, now what? What I am doing this for?"" It is really a simple concept. Did you always expect a 1st signature?  Yeah? Ok, well I don't see one,  so reject the message.  Sometimes?  Ok, fine. Status Quo. Did you expect a 3rd party signature?  No?  Ok, reject it.  Don't care?  ok, fine. Status Quo. etc, etc. I really don't see why it matters from where it sent and how.

If you have not already replied, it is still not too late to RSVP for
Gaven Martin's professorial lecture on Thursday the 3rd April. 

""Way beyond the parallel postulate: the revolution in modern geometry""

Abstract: 
Most will be unaware of the revolution that has occurred over the last
three decades in our mathematical understanding of the 3-dimensional
world in which we live. It turns out most three-dimensional geometric
spaces - such as that we live in - are hyperbolic. Hyperbolic geometry
is weird and interesting and offers greater possibilities to explain
many features of our universe. This lecture aims to communicate these
and other exciting new developments to a very general audience.

Staff, students and members of the public are welcome to this lecture.

Time:
7.00 Wine and Hors d'oeuvres
7.30pm Professorial Lecture

Where:
Sir Neil Waters Lecture Theatres Building, NW200.
Gate 1, Albany Expressway

RSVP - 
u.dgfphz@massey.ac.nz

Please note this lecture is free of charge.

Website:
http://auckland.massey.ac.nz

Future lectures in the Professorial Lecture Series are:

1 May - Professor Ben Jacobsen
""Financial Analysts: what are they good for?""

29 May - Professor Michael Townsend
""Research in education: science or common sense?""

Thank you for taking the time to reply, but unfortunately not much at
that url means anything to me.  Does it mean that this is a bug and I'll
have to wait for a fix?  Was it offering a solution? - if so I'm afraid
I didn't understand it.  The last message wasn't in a language I speak,
so I couldn't make anything of that.

I'm new at this, as you can probably tell, so if anyone could explain,
I'd be grateful.

Thanks

I am thinking of an entirely different scenario: a package of modules that 
are maybe a few hundred lines each and that accompany a book and are meant 
for human reading as much or more than for machine execution.

Or this: 15 minutes ago I was reading a PEP and discovered that a link did 
not work.  So I find the non-clickable author email at the top and notify 
the author with my email program.  But how much nicer to double click an 
adjacent line and stick the comment in place (and let your system do the 
emailing).  (I presume the sponsor of an item in your system can remove 
no-longer-needed comments.)  So I guess I am thinking of your system as one 
for collaborative online editing rather than just patch review.

Gosh, I dunno. I'm pretty sympathetic to the idea of method resolution
silently skipping over undefined bodies. I've gotten the impression
that the people responding to her are more out to brow-beat Linda than
argue about anything technical.

I've supposed that the real reason several people continued a thread
with her was that they were irritated at her tone.

PS: having to write defined(&{ ...->can(...) }) in user code to ignore
undefined bodies sucks.

	I disagree with my former self.  I won't say I firmly
am of opinion that \\&foo should return undef at execution time as it would
not be consistent with other var access.
	This doesn't mean I don't want a chance reference to a non-existent
local routine "" {\\&nonlocalsub }, interfering with a call through a blessed
reference.

---
	I'm not arguing for use of that dispatch table -- but I am arguing
that a ""stray"", ""random"" reference to an undefined sub should *OVERRIDE*
an OO-call properly looking up the method.

	The jump table you mention originally referred to all package
local calls, making all of the entries valid.  It was when the handling
routines got split into separate packages (classes) that the jump-table
no longer functioned.  I'm not arguing that the jump table, across packages
or classes ""should"" work.  Makes sense that it doesn't.

----
	Just because correctly functioning code is ""hard"" or
'difficult"" doesn't mean it should be avoided. A *defined* forward
reference should affect method resolution, but in OO implementation,
before OO returns a ""method is undefined"" error, it should look
through the parent classes.

---
	But when a function is ""forward referenced"", but not defined,
it already is in a ""semi-exists"" state.  I'm saying that when a function
is in that ""quasi"" state, it shouldn't *override* the parental lookup
machinery.  This was the *bug* I brought to the table  on 9-29.  That's
a MONTH ago.  Nobody had a clue that local, undefined methods would
stop perl's OO lookup machinery from working.

	On the other hand -- I strongly suspect I am not the only one
who has encounter this.  I'm just the first person who decided not to work
around the buggy code like everyone else does (don't use references;
use strings for method calls).  That sounded ""superstitious"" to me.  I
wanted to know what was wrong with what I was doing -- not just code
around it.

	When I did find the bug, it was big enough to drive a truck
through.  Many people suggested ways to work around this bug, but when
I pushed back with examples of things that didn't work -- that should have,
those people just stopped responding -- they had more important things
to do than going on some perl-bug hunt.  They knew how to work around
it -- that was the ""accepted"" way to do things (because taking the
reference would activate the bug), so why waste time tracking down why
my code was ""broken"".

	The above behavior -- where experienced perl-coders knew
""instinctively"", the way to work around it indicates to me that while
all of them knew how to code around that ""buggy area"", none of them were
able to tell me what part of my code was ""incorrect"" or why.

> So this seems very much a DDTT situation.  
---
	DDTT? (Don't do that thing?)  Regardless -- because
of people reactions to my probing (for a month), I don't think the
case is as infrequent as you would like to believe.  It's just
no one has been willing to deal with the flack ""you don't know what
you are doing"" or ""you just aren't willing to take our help"" (i.e.
not willing to code ""differently"", while not understanding why).

	Regardless of my reasons for pursuing the problem, when
the function is ""defined by reference"" and not really defined, it
is in a ""quasi"" state.  Why can't it look through the parent's methods
before throwing a fatal error?  It's not like it is going to be a
performance sensitive case, since the alternative if it isn't fixed
is just to die with a fatal error.

It is definitely File::Fetch.  I am still trying to find out all the 
places where it is broken on VMS.

Essentially it is trying to take apart a VMS file spec and then put it 
back together as a UNIX file specification and/or the reverse with the 
File::Spec methods, and that will not work.

The File::Spec methods do not have the information needed to do 
conversions of VMS to/from UNIX format.

File::Spec->catfile() on VMS currently expects that the first element in 
the array passed already be in VMS directory syntax.  If it is given an 
array of fragments of a UNIX specification, it will assume that is a 
relative path to the current working directory.

If you want to convert VMS 'foo:[bar.baz]file.gz' to a a URL, you really 
need to use VMS::Filespec::unixify() on it.  This will result in 
'/foo/bar/baz/file.gz'.

To reverse it to VMS format, VMS::Filespec::vmsify() or vmspath() should 
be used depending on if the result is a file or a directory.

Almost all routines in Perl on VMS with the exception of the File::Spec 
methods can handle UNIX pathnames with our requiring conversions, so 
converting a UNIX filespec to VMS format is usually only needed in rare 
cases.

What File::Fetch routines need to do, is on the input paths, use 
VMS::Filespec::unixify() on them to force them into UNIX syntax, and 
then treat them as UNIX syntax from then on.  Because File::Spec:: on 
VMS can not currently handle UNIX file specifications, File::Spec::UNIX 
routines need to be used.

Argh!  I was going to check the last of the PEP 3127 changes in tonight, 
but I won't make it by 6 pm EST.  I have them finished, but no tests 
written, so I'm not comfortable checking them in yet.  I guess it's no 
big deal that they slip until the next alpha.

Eric.

Summary: imap-tte

Initial Comment:
A patch that enables train-to-exhaustion support for IMAP.

This patch has three parts:

1. an __init__.py in the scripts folder that makes some of the classes in sb_imapfilter available to tte.py.  This change is not represented in the patch file; you'll have to add __init__.py yourself.

2. Some imap support in mboxutils.py

3. Some refactoring in sb_imapfilter.py to sink the port selection logic into IMAPSession.__init__ so that it can be used by tte.py.  In the process we simplify the uses of IMAPSession considerably.

This is probably not refactored in the best way; in particular, #1 above should probably never happen and whatever is used by both sb_imapfilter.py and tte.py should be moved into spambayes/ or at least out of scripts/.  However, before taking on any major restructuring I wanted to get this into the hands of a spambayes devel who can make sure I'm on the right track.

I'm a little curious about the -C flag.  The code reads:

         elif opt in (""-c"", ""--cullext""):
             cullext = arg
         elif opt in (""-C"", ""--cullext""):
             cullext = ''
In general it seems you cleaned up my crappy code in tte.py quite a bit. 
Thanks for that...  A couple comments:

* The ""--cullext"" can't work for both -C and -c.  Maybe you should have
""--cull"" (cull with no extension) to avoid conflict?  I made that change. 
Let me know if you have a different change in mind.

* I don't know the sb_imapfilter code at all.  I'll assign this to Tony in
case he has a moment to scan that part of the patch.  Tony, just mark it
closed if you agree with the changes or can easily change anything you take
issue with.

* You're using psycopg classifier?  Brave man. ;-)

I would like you to try it out a little, at least, before feeling
confident about it.  I've only used it on IMAP folders and I wouldn't want
to break the other use cases.

Dave,

Do you think this has stabilized well enough to apply to the
repository?  If so, I'll just make a quick review and apply
it.

That patch evolved yet again, massively.  I implemented a version of
culling for IMAP and refactored tte.py to greatly simplify it and remove
redundancy.  Hope you find that nice and not annoying ;-)

Job title: Small order processing job

Company name: hiller paper

Location: United States, WA, Spokane

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We are looking for a perl developer to create a script for us to help us in
upcoming ordering for our website. We are looking to use perl for this job
as it will quickly and effectively parse our orders. 


What we need the script to do is quantify each line in the order file to
see if the price for the product is correct.

So step by step what we are looking for from the perl script:

1. read in all orders in file order.csv
2. read in all prices for products in products.csv
3. compare all order line items, with the items cost in products.csv
4. omit all orders from problematic customers(problem_customers.csv)
5. export all orders that exceed product cost to file complete_orders.csv



An example of each file can be downloaded here:
http://w14.easy-share.com/1699699037.html(order.csv)
http://w15.easy-share.com/1699699003.html(products.csv)
http://w13.easy-share.com/1699699022.html(complete_orders.csv)
http://w13.easy-share.com/1699699027.html(problem_customers.csv)

 Im sure this is a small job for a professional perl developer. We will pay
via paypal for this job. Please email me with any questions and bids. Thank
you for your time reading this.


Required skills: Perl

Thanks for the info.

Actually one of the servers I'm thinking of
will be sleeping most of the time,
so maybe this flash mortality won't matter too much.

I wonder if VIA EPIA boards will suspend OK (with ACPI)?

Andy,

Does the fee you describe pay for (a) being allowed to do a high volume 
of direct DNS queries, ..OR.. (b) does it pay for an RSYNC feed to 
rbldnsd-formatted files?

If that is for high-volume direct queries, then why not check and see 
what an RSYNC-feed of an rbldnsd-formatted file might do for you, and 
the costs of the RSYNC feed?

(Also, at one point, you mentioned SURBL... but that was a typo and you 
are talking about URIBL, correct?)

I'd like to volunteer for Italian (and we, the Italian Python
community, do have reasonably good connections to the Italian
technical press, which is covering e.g. the upcoming Pycon Due
conference), and although my French is VERY rusty I can give it a try
if no native French speaker is forthcoming.

And that cpan-testers can then send out fail reports to module authors 
who clearly specified that their module doesn't even work with anything 
older than 5.8.x.... but the process in specifying this seems so 
delicate that an entire FAQ entry exists for that - instead that 
somebody fixes the testing framework to not bloody waste the collective 
time of people who live in this century...

 ""Let me put this bluntly.  If we'd done Perl 6 on a schedule, you'd 
have
 it by now.  And it would be crap.  Perl 6 will be ready when all the
 inputs are there, and all the event-driven decision circuits have had a
 chance to make their decisions.  We're not the least bit afraid to slip
 our schedule, because we don't have a schedule.  We just have a plan.""

The code which now fails was ran by cpan-testers on many many
systems, without problems in 5.6 and 5.8, but fails on all 5.10/5.9.5

According to the cpantesters results
(http://cpantesters.perl.org/show/Mail-Box.html), it looks like something
broke between 5.9.2 and 5.9.5.

By the way: quite some 5.9.5 tests reported successes, but actually
were failures.

I agree that most people think their code should run as fast as
possible, but in this particular case, common practice and common
sense diverge. If 80% of one's code makes only a negligible
contribution to performance, then clearly there is no need to optimize
it, but an average programmer will do it anyway. I imagine the best
programmers would probably do it too under social pressure. This is
not entirely fair, but one could say this change encourages average
programmers to keep their bad habits.

I understand the appeal of having a single API, but in this particular
case, there are two arguably distinct use cases: getting the keys of a
dict and iterating over the keys of the dict. One could change syntax
so that ""getting the keys"" would be spelled ""x.keys()"" and ""iterating
over the keys"" would look like

for k in keys of x:
  ...

or ','.join(k for k in keys of x)

(This would make 'keys' both a keyword and an identifier, so my
understanding is that this would entail a change in architecture of
the tokenizer and maybe parser as well; this strikes me as a temporary
but not intrinsic objection.)
To elaborate on the point of the impact on the programmer new to Python, I find

>>> x = {1:2}
>>> x.keys()
{1}

much more appealing than

>>> x.keys()


I taught (scheme) programming to high school students once, and I know
from experience that they try absolutely everything (most of it wrong
of course) because there are a million other confusing things to
learn. I think there is a real value in making a simple operation on a
core type as straightforward as possible.

I think the new module should only support the Unicode API. gettext is
about text, i.e. character strings; there is no need for byte-oriented
APIs.

NEUROBIOLOGISTS DISCOVER INDIVIDUALS WHO 'HEAR' MOVEMENT
Individuals with synesthesia, or cross-activated senses, perceive the world differently from others, with some perceiving numbers or letters as having colors or days of the week as possessing personalities. Now, researchers have discovered a type of synesthesia in which individuals hear sounds when they see things move or flash. The scientists say auditory synesthesia, which had never been identified, may represent an enhanced form of how the brain normally processes visual information.

HOW BACTERIA ATTACH TO HUMAN TISSUES DURING INFECTION PROCESS: NEW CLUES
Scientists have helped to reveal more about the way bacteria can attach to human tissues. The researchers studied the way a protein found on the surface of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus binds to a human protein called fibronectin. Their discovery is an important step in understanding how bacteria attach to the surface of blood vessels during infection.

SHAPE, NOT JUST SIZE, IMPACTS EFFECTIVENESS OF EMERGING NANOMEDICINE THERAPIES

METABOLIC INSIGHT TO ILLUMINATE CAUSES OF IRON IMBALANCE
New insight into key players in iron metabolism has yielded a novel tool for distinguishing among root causes of iron overload or deficiency in humans, researchers report. While the body needs iron to produce hemoglobin, a substance in red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen, too much iron can build up and eventually damage organs.

CONTEXT AND PERSONALITY KEY IN UNDERSTANDING RESPONSES TO EMOTIONAL FACIAL EXPRESSIONS
It is well-appreciated that facial expressions play a major role in nonverbal social communication among humans and other primates, because faces provide rapid access to information about the identity and the internal states and intentions of others. New data now suggests that both the social context of a person's facial expression and certain facets of the viewer's personality could affect how our brain interprets the social meaning of someone else's smile or frown.

WHY TREATMENT ISN'T EFFECTIVE FOR HIV
Researchers have answered a key question as to why antiretroviral therapy isn't effective in restoring immunity in HIV-infected patients. Once a person is infected with the virus, fibrosis, or scarring, occurs in the lymph nodes -- the home of T cells that fight infection. And once fibrosis occurs, T cells can't repopulate the lymph nodes when HIV therapy begins, according to a professor of medicine and principal investigator on the study.

RISK OF UNINTENTIONAL INJURY DEATH IS HIGH FOR YOUNG CHILDREN LIVING WITH UNRELATED ADULTS
In a new study, a University of Missouri professor found that children living in households with unrelated adults are six times more likely to die of maltreatment-related unintentional injuries, compared to children living with two biological parents. The risk of maltreatment death is double for children living with foster or step-parents, or other related adults. However, the risk is not higher for children living in households with a single biological parent and no other adults.

Similar antivirus ""chains"" are sometimes fooled by source-routing, uucp
notation and other old plain addressing tricks. At the first stage the
message is accepted as locally destinated, at the second stage it
becomes locally originated and is properly routed to the remote destination.

Of course, I don't say that this specific setup is vulnerable. But the
milter model seems to be more transparent and predictable.

Not necessarily in the middle of REs, but what about before them?

There's plenty of whitespace and opportunity to support basic line

Also, meta rules tend to get really long, and it would make a difference
if one can fold them.

FWIW, I'd appreciate this, too. :)

SCOURGE OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES
If you can't wait to get home to open that bottle of Shiraz that's been waiting on the kitchen counter, think again. Research from Liverpool reveals Britain's middle class drinking habits are increasingly dangerous. More and more of us in affluent areas are now classed as hazardous drinkers. Is this a precursor to alcohol tax rises? Should the government try to change the drinking culture, not just of those yobs on the street corners but of the masses who regard themselves as moderates too?

We shall be talking to restaurateur and bon viveur Anthony Worrall Thompson and one of those who feel things must change.

NORTHERN ROCK TAKES HAMMERING FROM MPS
The directors and chairman of Northern Rock took an absolute hammering today at the hands of MPs in Westminster. But apart from the political theatre, the appearance has revealed a number of inconsistencies in the evidence given by the various players in that momentous week when Britain endured the first run on a bank in more than 100 years. The directors appear to think they did little wrong, were the victims of circumstance, and that the Bank of England could have prevented the whole crisis. We shall be talking to the Treasury committee chairman John McFall.

FINAL COUNTDOWN FOR OBAMA?
In Iowa Sarah Smith has grabbed a rare interview on British television with Barack Obama. He's been targeting that state in the knowledge that if he does badly there in the Democratic primaries, he's sunk. With Hillary Clinton apparently way out ahead, is it really looking over for Obama? Or could he pull off something special in a state not known for its huge number of black voters?

Sounds 
great. One quick question: what is the size of the js download to the client... 
we have a pretty heavy client side code situation already, and want to 
understand how much extra transfer to the client your code would 
cause.
 
Can 
you send whatever license agreement or tell me how and what to pay....  
thank you for offering occasional updates, that is appreciated. What we can do 
is check your site occasionally and ask you to make us a downloadable package if 
we require the new features or fixes.
 
p.s.
thank 
you for your cooperation. I think also we may give a nod to you guys in your 
site FAQ, as a thanks.

Tony, hi
 
We can create a downloadable package for you which would 
  contain the unbranded slideshow JavaScript and all images that the script 
  references. You can then host it on your own server, provided that you do not 
  modify the code. If security is your concern, you can inspect the JavaScript 
  source to make sure it is not a security risk. 
 
We'll try to update the downloadable package on a regular 
  basis so that you would have access to the newest features, but you'll have to 
  check for updates yourself. Chances are you won't need any updates 
  anyway.
 
Please let me know if this is acceptable for 
  you.

Hi 
    guys,
 
Cool stuff your 
    slideshow demo. However, our business model requires us to provide security 
    guarantees to our customer base,
and so we must 
    have all code on our own premises. Can you license me the unbranded 
    version
along with all 
    the javascript libraries? You can give me the js library as obfuscated 
    however you want, I just
don't want any 
    calls to a server outside my domain. Also, if your server goes down, that 
    would kill
my service, and 
    I can't have that. I can sign a license agreement, we are a California 
    corporation with a real
physical office 
    space.
 
I'd happily pay 
    your $500 fee for this product, even though my site is only going to beta in 
    April. 
 
Please let me as 
    soon as possible... we have integrated the code
and it suits our 
    purpose well. You may see hits from 75.49.99.38 today as we were testing the 
    branded version.

           http://hmi.ewi.utwente.nl/conference/benelearn2005



Benelearn is the annual machine learning conference of Belgium and
The Netherlands. It serves as a forum for researchers in this field to
exchange ideas and present recent work. The official language of the
conference is English. Benelearn 2005 will be organized by the Human
Media Interaction (HMI) Group of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering,
Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) at the University of Twente
in the Netherlands.

Benelearn wants to broaden its focus to disciplines that are closely
related to Machine Learning. Therefore, we invite papers relevant to
machine learning and related disciplines in the broadest sense,
especially papers that cross borders between disciplines, for example
in bioinformatics and machine learning in multi-modal interaction.
Possible paper topics include, but are not limited to:

   Kernel Methods                     Decision-Theoretic Planning
   Bayesian Networks                  Case-based Learning
   Computational Learning Theory      Data Mining
   Evolutionary Computation           Hybrid Learning Systems
   Graphical Models                   Inductive Learning
   Inductive Logic Programming        Knowledge Discovery in Databases
   Language Learning                  Learning and Problem Solving
   Learning by Analogy                Learning in Multi-Agent Systems
   Learning in Dynamic Domains        Learning to/for Search
   Multistrategy Learning             Neural Networks
   Reinforcement Learning             Robot Learning
   Scientific Discovery               Meta-Learning
   Statistical Methods                Probabilistic Logic Learning     
   Applications of Machine Learning, e.g.
      Bioinformatics
      Multi-Modal Interaction
      Speech & Language Processing
      Robotics
      Web/Link Mining
      Computer Games

Papers are limited to 8 pages (using a 11pt Times Roman font),
including figures, title page, references, and appendices. Style files
can be downloaded from the conference web site. The papers will be
primarily refereed on their relevance to the conference, and according
to clarity and overall quality criteria.

Looking into this more, I have disabled the HABEAS checks altogether 
(setting score to 0).  I did consider the suggestions about lowering the 
impact by setting the score to -0.5 or similar, but actually I don't 
like the concept of this service, and I would rather save the bandwidth 
and not do the checks altogether.

Thanks to everyone for their comments.

I don't think either TR#36 or TR#39 are applicable here. This is not
identifier syntax; there may various symbols and whatnot in the
string, which should also be rendered as-is.

The escaping that repr() does is *not* to achieve unambiguity,
but to achieve printability.

That may be the case now, and with that particular code. It's still very
fragile to *count* on this being true. Python 3.0 should not and must not
have backward compatibility cruft. It defeats the whole point of 3.0 and
devalues it to the point of uselessness. It's just plain silly to discuss
it.

What can be done is adding a future statement to 2.6 to make '' be identical
to u'': 'from __future__ import unicode_strings' or such, but it doesn't

It'll do a much better job than try-and-pray. It may not matter in any of
your code, but I really suggest not relying on it. Use 2to3.

I think like most other people on this list I care enough to dislike

What's happening here is that the tests are trying the ""pipe""  
mechanism that was added for HP-UX. If is enabled when /dev/log is a  
pipe instead of being a socket (most other Unix) or a character  
device (z/OS). Could you give me the output of the following commands:

   $ ls -lF /dev/log
   $ perl -le 'print join$"",-w shift&&""writable"",-S _&&""socket"",-c  
_&&""char"",-p _&&""pipe""'  /dev/log

My guess is that the tests are hitting a bug in the Linux syslog  
driver, where the device with this old kernel also appears like a  
pipe even though it's supposed to appears like a socket. (IIRC, Unix  
domain sockets are implemented with named pipe, or the reverse, and  
the bug here is that the kernel isn't hiding enough the underlying  
mechanism).

to be extremely cautious with the private part of the certificate, or
it's worthless. That means that there will probably be only one person
who can sign binaries. That person would have also have to build all
the binaries -- signing binaries you retrieved from the internet
sounds like a complete bypassing of the security procedures. *And*
that person would forever have to be extremely cautious with the
machine on which the certificate resides, keeping it turned off and
locked away securely most of the time, or else risk that the machine
is infected by malware, again bypassing the point. While the chances
of ever signing something bad are low, the bad effects could be huge
(sort of like the risk of an earthquake as compared to a car crash).

I'm not at all sure that we are set up to do this right, and that it
is worth the minor inconvenience to users of having to acknowledge a
red-flag dialog. After all, they will be ack'ing such dialogs all the
time if they are at all used to downloading software from the
internet.

The change is correct, but exposes a flaw earlier in the same method.
""_rbufsize == 1"" represents a request to buffer ""by line"", which is
clearly irrelevant in this context.  A request to read n bytes should
just use the default buffer size if buffering ""by line"".  Sample patch
is attached.

this hasn't been beaten to death already.

I've been doing some compatibility tests with 3.0a3, 2.6a1 and 2.5, to
see exactly what breaks and how and if you can get around it,
basically to see if it is possible to write code that runs under both
2.6 and 3.0 without too much pain. It's looking rather encouraging,
most differences have easy workarounds. Some of them need try/except
clauses which could be collected in a small compatibility module
installable as an egg for those who want it.

There is one big problem though, and it's unicode. I'm happy to see
that 2.6 has the b'data' syntax as an alias for 'data', to make it
easier to port code from 2.6 to 3.0. But 3.0 doesn't support the
u''syntax, and that means that it gets very hard to use unicode in an
application and run it under 2.6 and 3.0. You can get around it with
this workaround:

    try:
        u = unicode
    except NameError:
        u = str
    text = u(""This is unicode"")

But this is still not perfect, as this means you only can have
ascii-texts in the unicode strings. That's OK for people like me that
use Zope, because we'll use i18n tools to localize texts anyway, but I
suspect it's not going to be OK for others. Also, it's ugly. :-)


I would really like to see u'text' support in Python 3.0, as an alias
for 'text'. If we can have that, it means that 90% of all code I have
written will just straight of in Python 3.0 (yeah, really), and most
of the remaining code can be fixed with conditional imports of the
renamed standard modules.

Admittedly, this is because I rarely use xrange or iterkeys. Also, I
rarely print, I use the logging module, and so on. But I don't think
that is so unusual, is it?


So, please allow u'' in Python 3.0! With that change, my
porting/compatibility worried would be gone, and  you would be able to
choose between the three porting strategies dependningon how your code
base and user base looks: 1. Clean break. 2. Syncing with 2to3, 3.
Supporting both 2.6 and 3.0.

Sorry, I did. It fell off when I fixed the shifts that apeared when
copying. Fixed it again.
I seem to have forgotten what the bar meant. I knew it when I needed
it for a test, but I lost it.
Is it the arithmic mean? The arithmic mean is a way of averaging, if
wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean) is correct.
The average of a sine (if N cycles are taken) is 0.
If the arithmic mean of a sine is plotted over a time period the
result would be the exact same sine.
The result of this would be that RMS is a useless value. It is not,
and therefore my reasoning must be flawed somewhere. Does anyone have
the time, knowledge and will to take the quest of finding this flaw? I
seem to be unable to.

I re-read this message this evening and realized I came across
incredibly rude.

I wrote this right after I woke up and was kind of dumping my thoughts

sincere apology, and I hope you'll believe me when I say it wasn't
intended to be rude. (and yes, I know that's not going to be easy to

edgy due to my still shaking off sleep, but it certainly was not nearly
this rude in intent).

So, I publicly apologize to you for:
     writing so rudely
     posting without reading or considering my wording
     posting while still sleepy and in a hurry
    allowing my sleepiness to make me a bit grumpy.

However I hope the factual information of the email is helpful to you.

That's purely a coincidence. My dad was an architect and took me on

Hey Barry,

Thanks for putting this PEP together.  This is really helpful.

I didn't see discussion of PEP 3118 and it's features back-ported to 
Python 2.6.  I've already back-ported the new buffer API as an addition 
to the old buffer protocol.

In addition, I've planned to back-port the improvements to the struct 
module and the addition of the memoryview object (both in PEP 3118).

If you have questions, we can talk tomorrow.

Best regards,

-Travis Oliphant

See the subject. What do you say about d.items()?

I think there is zero chance to revert that decision now.

I found this on the web but don't see where in spamassassin I can set it.


It is definately Sys:Syslog causing the problem.  If you look in the actual
spamd file, it gives some indication of this.  I found that if I specified
my log file options in the spamassassin options files that the problem is
resolved.  Add something like -s /var/log/spam.d to the existing options and
the error clears.

I have the lastest and greatest Sys::Syslog installed.

Well, you couldn't be further behind than me.

                 SPECIAL SESSION ON WEB INTELLIGENCE
                        Deadline: December 15

                       Organized in the scope of:

 7th International FLINS Conference on Applied Artificial Intelligence

                  Genova, Italy, August 29-31, 2006

          


                  ** Themes and Goals **

In our current age of booming internet technology and resources, Web
Intelligence (WI) addresses the challenge of transforming the Web from
 a static data and information repository into an interactive, dynamic,
transparent and secure knowledge and service network. Specifically, WI
 is aimed at enhancing available web tools with artificial intelligence
techniques, enabling them to flexibly index, search and mine vast amounts
of semi- or even unstructured web data without the direct need for
human intervention. Also, WI provides methods and tools for flexibly
extracting and maintaining ontology-based description metadata formats,
as well as trust and reputation assertions.

                  ** Topics of Interest **


This session aims to highlight innovations in the domain of intelligent
technologies for the WWW. In particular, we welcome original contributions
pertaining to, but not necessarily limited to, the following topics:

    * Soft computing techniques (fuzzy sets, rough sets, neural nets,
      genetic algorithms, ...) for knowledge extraction and representation
    * Fuzzy and approximate reasoning on the Semantic Web
    * Flexible user modeling and weblog analysis
    * Hybrid techniques for Web-based recommendation systems
    * Intelligent trust and reputation processing
    * Web-based decision support
    * Social network intelligence
    * Intelligent human-web interaction
    * Automatic generation of (fuzzy) ontologies

                  ** Paper submission **

Prospective authors are invited to submit papers of up to 8 pages by email
to Chris Cornelis. All submitted papers will be judged on their quality and
relevance. Formatting details for preparing your paper can be found at
http://www.fuzzy.ugent.be/flins2006
Submissions are due December 15, 2005.

Most remote mail clients and servers ignore these I would say. They're a
great way for spammers to know if their messages made it or not.

I think this was all captured in amk's statement ""RPM-like

the permissions are all correct. So if the administrator mistakenly
does a chown -R on a subtree, he can get back to what it was with
the package manager, without having to reinstall everything, or can
atleast find out what packages he broke.

IIUC, the Solaris package manager provides the same feature.

MSI provides a ""repair installation"", which doesn't really check
anything, but reruns the entire installation (and then skipping
those files who passed the checksum test, where checksums had
been recorded in the MSI).

bit.  Compat.t was not being run on VMS because it could not determine 
if the  image was present.

It still can not, but assumes that it is on VMS now.


In Module/Build.pm :

It is vmsish if OS is VMS and the make program is one of MMK or MMS.

Overriding localize_file_path and localize_dir_path in Platform/VMS.pm 
now, so do not need is_vmsish here.

A catdir() should be a catfile().

Add the filenames generated on VMS to the Manifest skip list.


In Compat.pm :

glob on VMS will not handle tildes, so use the Module::Build->_detildefy 
to help.

Generated Makefile - Descrip.mms needs some changes for MMS/MMK.

1. Perl image needs to be preceded by MCR.

2. It is Build.COM instead of just Build.

3. Unlink of the makefile is done differently for realclean target.

4. MMS/MMK do not support .EXPORT.


Set the makefile to be Descrip.MMS when building for MMS/MMK on VMS.

MMS/MMK will use 'Makefile', but that could confuse things.

Note:  Do not use 'Makefile.vms' for a MMS/MMK style makefile.  It 
breaks GNU make in the GNV kit, as it chooses Makefile.vms over a plain 
Makefile when searching.


In Compat.t :

If using VMS and MMK/MMS assume that MMS or MMK is present.  The only 
practical way to test to see if an program is present on VMS is to try 
to run it.

find_in_path simply will not work on VMS, so not fixing the issues in it 
where it is not handling VMS format file specifications correctly and 
emitting diagnostics, just not using it on VMS.

If on VMS and using MMK or MMS, assume that the makefile is 'Descrip.MMS'.

TEST_VERBOSE = 0, must be done by setting and restoring the environment 
variable on VMS.  This is because Perl on VMS is using logical names for 
environment variables, and this is incompatible with MMS/MMK macros.

The non-verbose output on VMS is apparently slightly different, as there 
  appears to be extra newlines inserted.


In VMS.pm :

Do not quote ""/qualifiers"" which are already in VMS syntax.

Add localize_file_path and localize_dir_path to use VMS::Filespec 
routines, and so will handle most VMS and UNIX format names.  The 
existing ones were just passing through the VMS format names with out 
changing them, which was good enough for the tests, but would have 
mangled the UNIX format names on VMS.

Probably have to revise those two when implementing support for gnu make 
on VMS, as then the result should be in LINUX format.


With this patch, compat.t now passes all tests.

We still have two issues with Module build on VMS:

1. ppm.t fails because it is apparently creating a corrupt compressed 
tarball..

2. xs.t is failing because it is mis-interpreting how to lookup blib. 
It is not failing when run in the Perl debugger.

Another case of more damage from well-meaning administrators than actual

Postfix 2.5 includes suppor for mandatory minimum message spacing by

No rate limit. If latency is low enough, even a concurrency limit of 1
will not be slow enough.

Yes, 2.5 adds support for per-destination rate limits. Really intended
for users of SOHO ISP MSAs, the fact that you have to do this for a major
ISP inbound MX host is rather sad.

If your users really do want your content, they should move their
mailboxes elsewhere. Other bulk senders likely split the load over
multiple sending IPs to compensate... This is lame. Of course if your
content is less popular with the users than with you, you are out of luck...

Eoin Parker <gcto.fuidgm@gmail.com>,Ie-Rant <pq-mism@yahoogroups.com>,"Wed, 06 Aug 2008 18:29:38 +0100",[ie-rant] surprising: obesity is now a bigger problem than hunger in 3rd world countries,"'Thrifty genes' blamed as obesity rivals hunger

* Under the Microscope:* There are now more overweight people than hungry
people in rapidly developing countries. This rather surprising fact is
reported by Barry M Popkin in the September 2007 issue of * Scientific
American,* writes * Prof William Reville*


As a consequence, obesity is a more serious health risk than hunger in most
of these nations. Traditionally, under-nutrition was a serious health risk
in these countries, but a dramatic change driven by globalisation has
occurred over the past 20 years.

Popkin reports that in countries such as Egypt, South Africa and Mexico more
than half the adults are either overweight or obese. These weight categories
are defined by body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated as your body weight
in kilos divided by the square of your height in metres. A BMI of 25 to 29
is defined as overweight and a BMI of 30 and above as obese. These criteria
are very strict at the lower limits - for example someone with a BMI of 26
will scarcely look overweight and, so, the obesity statistics quoted above
may not be quite as alarming as they seem. Nevertheless it is clear that a
serious problem exists, and it is growing. Obesity correlates with diabetes,
heart disease and other illnesses and a public health crisis is threatened
for these economies.

Popkin homes in on Mexico as a specific example. Fewer than 10 per cent of
Mexicans were overweight in 1989, but surveys in 2006 showed that 71 per
cent of Mexican women and 66 per cent of men were overweight or obese (these
figures rival the figures in the US). In 1989, diabetes was very rare in
Mexico but today almost one seventh of the population suffers from
adult-onset (Type Two) diabetes and diabetes is spreading fast.

Over the past 20 years, living styles have changed dramatically in countries
such as India, Mexico, China and the Philippines. Supermarket chains have
spread to those regions and as average incomes rise poorer people have
adopted dietary and exercise habits that lead to obesity - consuming sugary
soft drinks and foods, watching TV, riding motorbikes instead of walking,
and buying convenient processed foods from supermarkets.

People are now consuming much more energy-dense food such as vegetable oils
and food derived from animals (meat, fish, eggs and dairy products). The
combination of a more sedentary lifestyle and high-calorie food intake has
precipitated an obesity problem that is concentrated in the poorest sections
of these societies where access to education that would promote healthy
eating and exercise is severely limited.

Popkin describes the interesting hypothesis that obese people in these
countries may be more susceptible to developing diabetes or high blood
pressure than obese people in the developed world. The argument is that
populations in Latin America, Africa and South East Asia carry a
disproportionate number of ""thrifty genes"" that evolution selected in order
to help survival during famines by enabling people to store fat more
efficiently in times of plenty. Unfortunately when high calorie food becomes
freely available, a person with these genes efficiently accumulates fat
around the heart and liver, increasing the risk of diabetes and heart
disease. Popkin reports that nearly one third of people in China, where
obesity is sharply increasing, suffer from high blood pressure.

People in these regions are rapidly switching from their traditional
low-fat, high-fibre diets to calorie-rich fats, sweeteners and refined
carbohydrates. One of the biggest contributors to obesity is the sweetened
beverage. Over most of our evolutionary history, after weaning, the only
beverages we took were breast milk, and water. Water has no calories and we
never evolved mechanisms to automatically reduce food intake to compensate
for beverage consumption. Up to 50 years ago the average proportion of
dietary calories contributed by beverages was small but this is no longer
the case as sugary soft drinks have spread everywhere on earth. The average
Mexican now consumes more soft drinks than the average US citizen.

Other key contributors to obesity are energy-dense foods such as vegetable
oils, meat, fish, eggs and milk. Technological advances and government
subsidies in the production of oilseeds have made vegetable oils cheap. And
most of the growth of the world production of meat, fish and dairy produce
has come from these nations and this is injecting excessive amounts of
saturated fat into the average diet thereby greatly increasing the risk of
cardiovascular disease.

Globalisation means the free movement of capital, technology, goods and
services around the world and is the main driver of the changes in diet and
lifestyle described in this article. Of course globalisation also confers
benefits on many of these countries such as encouragement of trade,
introduction of technology, improvement in employment, and so on, but
unfortunately there are many negative effects such as the obesity problems
described in this article. Remedial measures must be put in place to reverse
these negative effects.

Unless strong preventive policies are implemented the medical costs of
obesity-related illness could topple the economies of China, India and other
rapidly developing countries. China already spends six per cent of its GDP
on nutrition-related chronic diseases. Popkin suggests restructuring the
huge agricultural subsidies that encourage the production of meat and dairy
products, thereby encouraging farmers to grow fruit and vegetables. New
policies should also promote the consumption of more whole grains, with
their enhanced fibre, vitamins and minerals, as opposed to refined
carbohydrates. Taxes should be imposed on caloric sweeteners in order to
discourage their consumption.

Hrm. So on the one hand, you're right; on the other hand, there are lots of places where for the purposes of the law (and the purposes of policy) we can safely assume deletion actually occurs. Where that line is is probably the subject of an interesting paper. For the purposes of the user, 'deletion' happens when I no longer have access to the data. Maybe that is a more clear definition. Any hard drive wiping/shredding/whatever is really moot for the user at that point, unless they want to sue to get access again.

There is nothing to resolve. Carlos just refuses to use the tools provided by

And it's why Hash/Util/FieldHash failed to build statically on Win32
when the ALL_STATIC option was added in #31784.

I've now applied this patch to win32/FindExt.pm too, so now
Hash/Util/FieldHash can be included in the ALL_STATIC build.

That is, I see the ""reducing meta-operator"" as a way of taking a

albeit one with a funny name.  As such, you should be able to do
things with a reduced operator in the same way that you could with any

I just moved my speakers to my 10.3 based system and the sound works fine. 
Both system have SBLive cards. One system is a P2 with 768K Ram, 866MHZ 
processor. It has XP for TAX softeare only and 10.3 for testing after I was 
unable to install 10.3 on my other system with Asus Mother board and SIS SATA 
controllers. The is an open bug on that. Other system is P4. It has 10.2 and 
11.0a2, each on separate disk.

On 10.3 the sound just worked after install. Is it possible the sound problem 
is only on 64 bit systems?

That's a good question.  It's been years since I used it (Mac SE connecting
to VMS days), but lots of people use it to maintain logins.  If you get
disconnected your session on the remote machine stays alive.  The nex time
you run screen you are reconnected to that session.  Perfect for flaky
communications.

If repr() is made to work as Martin suggests (i.e. only escape the 
unprintable stuff), then the unicode_escape codec can be used fairly 
easily to restore the 2.x escape everything non-ASCII behaviour.

Cheers,
Nick.

(sorry my poor english)

Hi,

I have a machine with qmail+qmail-scanner+spamassassin 3.0.0. Some time ago,
I have saw that some spam are passing through filter with 0 score. Then, I
activated sa_debug='1' and sa_hdr_report='1' in qmail-scanner for see how SA
are giving the score to e-mails and I saw that many e-mails don't have any
XX_BAYES score. I think that all e-mails should be this score, with more or
less score, but all should be marked with a XX_BAYES.

Why happen this? I want use bayes for all messages.

Any fix?

Thank you very much

The above uses os.listdir(), which I've had problems with in the past with
huge directories (I can't recall, but I suspect it was simply performance
that sucked).  Either way, the fastest I've come up with has been based
around:

    for fd in win32file.FindFilesIterator(os.path.join(dir, ""*"")):
        name = fd[8]
        if name in ('.', '..'):
            continue

See the docs for how the 'fd' tuple is laid out.

Cheers,
 
Mark

The earlier failures for the transport can easily be for a different queue
id. The cause is earlier in the log.

The Top   Justifications to Attend TechMentor by Greg Shields


Greg   Shields is an independent author, speaker and consultant based in Denver, Colorado.. With more than 10 years of   experience in information technology, Greg has developed extensive experience in   systems administration, engineering, and architecture. Greg is a contributing   editor for Redmond magazine,   MCPmag.com, and Virtualization Review authoring regular columns along with   numerous feature articles, Webcasts, and white papers. He is also the resident   editor for Realtime Publishers’ Windows Server Community.   Greg is currently finishing his new book Windows 2008:  What’s New, What’s Changed through SAPIEN Press.


Attending IT conferences is  a major part of the job of an administrator. In an industry that changes  constantly, only there do you get up-to-the-second information to do your job  in the best and most efficient way possible The hardest part is usually  convincing the “powers that be” to fund your trip.
My name is Greg Shields, and  as Chair of TechMentor’s  Tips, Tricks, & Troubleshooting Track, I want to see you learning the  latest developments and tricks to work smarter and faster. The entire team of  track chairs and I have spent much of the last half-year putting together what  we think is the best TechMentor yet. So, in the interest of helping you out,  let me see if I can’t get you a list of the top justifications you can use to  convince your boss and your business to let you come:

By attending Bruce  Mackenzie-Low’s Troubleshooting  Windows Crashes & Hangs session you’ll be able to fix a blue-screened  server rather than have to rebuild it from scratch.
Learning what you need  to know from my Tips You  Should Know for Preventing an Active Directory Failure session could save  your entire company!
For a ridiculously low  price, you’ll get eight hours of hi-energy instruction on Windows Server  2008 from yours truly! Nowhere else can you get a deal like this, and you  need to know Microsoft’s newest operating system.
 TechMentor’s Expo is one of the rare places where you can get one-on-one with vendors for the  technologies you need. (Don’t mention the free beer)
If you’ve been afraid of  migrating to Windows Vista, world renowned instructor James Conrad has got the  session for you: Migrating  from XP to Vista: Don’t Fear, Stop Waiting, Here’s Why!
E-mail is a  mission-critical part of virtually every business, and it’s your job to keep it  running. But you can’t do that without the best tips, like you’ll get in Peter  Bruzzese’s Top  Tips for Exchange 2007 session. 
Unlike a lot of other  conferences out there, TechMentor is completely independent. That means you’ll  get the straight scoop on today’s tech, without the party line.

Lastly, tell your boss  that this TechMentor is co-located with VSLive. That means you’re  actually getting two conferences in one. Now, isn’t that some pretty good cost  savings?

I hope to see you there!

CONFERENCE PROGRAMME:
=====================

The aim of the conference is to bring together interested researchers from
AI and OR, and to give them the opportunity to show how the integration of
techniques from AI and OR can lead to interesting results on large scale and
complex problems. A secondary aim of CP-AI-OR is to provide an opportunity
for researchers in one area to learn about techniques in others.

>>From almost 100 submitted papers, 26 papers have been selected to be
presented in the main program.

MASTER CLASS:
=============

As in previous years CPAIOR'05, a major forum on the Integration of OR
and AI techniques in CP, will be preceded by a one-day Master Class
where leading researchers give introductory and overview talks in a
given area. This year, the topic of the Master Class is
Metaheuristics and Constraint Programming. The Master Class is
intended for PhD students, researchers, and practitioners. A basic
knowledge of Constraint Programming will be expected of participants.

So you're going to dual-life this module ? (Don't forget all the
patches that have come in blead until very recently then)

Since in blead the XS implementation will be always used, I don't see
a pressing need to update it there. I mean, at some point, we must
stop patching.

Thank you for your comment.

You can raise UnicodeEncodigError for encoding errors if you want, by
setting sys.stdout's error-handler to `strict`.

Even though this PEP was rejected, I'll still propose to change
default error-handler for sys.stdout and for sys.stderr to
'backslashreplace'. For Python 2, 'strict' error-handler is acceptable
because most of text data are 8-bit string, but for Py3K, raising
exceptions when the printed text contains a character not supported by
console is annoying.

Sure. I missed some cases, such as cgitb module or logging module.
I'll investigate them later. If you have another candidate, please let
me know.

I changed a patch to add a flag to the _PyUnicode_TypeRecords table,
so the Unicode database is not loaded at stat up.

I think global setting is not flexible enough. And I see no benefit to
customizable repr() except to keep compatible with Python 2, but I
think it is easy to migrate the existing code to the Py3k.

Please note that the submission deadline has been extended to Sep. 15th!

***************************************************************************

The workshop ""Methods for Modalities"" (M4M) aims to bring together
researchers interested in developing algorithms, verification methods and
tools based on modal logics. Here the term ""modal logics"" is conceived
broadly, including description logic, guarded fragments, conditional logic,
temporal and hybrid logic, etc.

   To stimulate interaction and transfer of expertise, M4M will feature a
number of invited talks by leading scientists, research presentations aimed
at highlighting new developments, and submissions of system demonstrations.
We strongly encourage young researchers and students to submit papers and
posters, especially for experimental and prototypical software tools which
are related to modal logics.

Invited speakers:
   François Laroussinie, ENS Cachan and CNRS
   Martin Lange, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität
   Wim Martens, Hasselt University
   Boris Motik, Universität Karlsruhe
   Boris Konev, University of Liverpool
   Uwe Scheffler, Humboldt Universität

   Regular papers should not exceed the length of 12 pages; short papers are
up to six pages of length, and posters and tools can be presented on two
pages of text. Proceedings will appear online and as a Humboldt university
report. Depending on the submissions, papers may be selected to appear in a
special issue of an appropriate journal.
Submission is by internet or email. You can (preferrably) upload your
PostScript or PDF contribution to the address
http://www.easychair.org/M4M-4/submit/ or (alternatively) send it to
m4m-4@first.fraunhofer.de.

   The workshop will take place in Berlin - Adlershof, Germany, which is one
of the worlds largest science and technology areas, comprising twelve
research institutes, six faculties of the Humboldt University of Berlin, and
more than 370 high tech companies. It is hosted by FIRST, the Fraunhofer
Institute of Computer Architecture and Software Technology, in collaboration
with the computer science institute of Humboldt University.

For more information and registration information, see the M4M homepage at
   http://m4m.loria.fr/

  Deadline for submissions: September 15th, 2005 (extended!)
  Notification: October 17, 2005
  Camera ready versions: November 8, 2005
  Workshop dates: December 1-2, 2005

The program committee for M4M consists of
   Holger Schlingloff, Humboldt University / FIRST (local organizations);
   Carlos Areces, INRIA Lorraine;
   Patrick Blackburn, INRIA Lorraine;
   Torben Brauner, Roskilde University;
   Stephane Demri, ENS de Cachan;

Yes, and other core tests are sensitive to load (stress tests for
threads, Benchmark.pm, ...). So that would be useful. But since that
probably needs to be discussed at the TAP level, please followup-to
perl-qa.

Background and Aim of the Conference
  
The ejhwh.owwdhnk@Internet conference was first started in May 2000
with the aim of providing a forum for the exchange of ideas and
research results among professionals and students interested in
following the issues and solutions to their possible ill effects, and
issues and solutions to supporting the numerous applications of the
Internet that have broad consequences on humans and the society.
  
The technical themes of the 2005 edition of the conference are
organized around two tracks as follows:
  
Track I: Impacts of the Internet on Humans and the Society


   1. negative side effects of the Internet on humans and the society,
that is, the uses of the Internet that have caused monetary damages,
invasion of privacy, violation of intellectual rights, social
problems, and even undesirable outcomes in elections, etc. These
include, but are not limited to, spam; viruses, worms, and phishing;
digital rights violations; frauds in electronic commerce, mobile
commerce and auctions; hacking and intrusion; cyber terror and cyber
warfare; invasion of privacy and identify theft; attacks against the
Internet infrastructure, including denial of service attacks; exposure
of children to unsavory things; hijacking of democracy by a small but 
vocal minority; bad web communities, such as suicide websites,
crime-aiding websites; marriage breakups; rude words in opinions
posted to websites; etc.

   2. technical, legal, business model, and mass education-based
solutions to address ill effects from the uses of the Internet, as
mentioned above.

Track II: Applications of the Internet That Have Broad Positive
Impacts on Humans and the Society

   1. both established and emerging uses of the Internet that have or
are expected to have positive effects on humans and the society, that
is, applications and uses of the Internet that expand commerce and
economy, enhance quality of life, improve government's services to
people, diversify the interactions and relationships among people in
communities of varying sizes and purposes, etc. These include, but are
not limited to, electronic commerce, mobile commerce, auction, online 
games, entertainment, education and learning, health care, governance,
politics, Internet telephony, e-mass media (digital newspapers,
radio), e-family, e-communities, etc.

   2. technologies to support the applications mentioned above.

Change the transport table to point the destination to a bogus
transport (no master.cf entry required) after adding that transport
to defer_transports. Later undo the transport table change, reload
Postfix and finally drop the bogus transport for ""defer_transports"".

    main.cf:
	defer_transports = deferall
	transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport

    transport:
	example.com		deferall:downtime

This will defer mail for just example.com. With Postfix 2.4 and later,
use the ""retry"" transport instead and don't change ""defer_transports"":

    main.cf:
	transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport

    transport:
	example.com		retry:4.2.1 Scheduled down-time

With 2.4 and later, deferred transports are automatically handed over
to the ""retry"" transport, so you get more control by just using that
directly.

Do you mean ""existing eggs"" or does that include the (potential .egg) package
that is being installed? If I understood correctly, this bootstrap module
currently supports installing eggs (although I'm not sure how they are
supposed to work without the current way of keeping a .pth file).

Is it *wanted* that eggs are being supported by core Python?

If this is a public MX, you can't enforce authentication, otherwise we

Hm, I could imagine objects that need to be finalized in the thread that created them.
How could that be handled?

   Learning Track of the 2008 International Planning Competition

                     Call for Participation

               http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/ipc-learn/
==================================================================

The International Planning Competition (IPC) is a biennial event
organized in the context of the International Conference on Automated
Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS). This year we are pleased to introduce
a new learning track of the competition to complement the existing
deterministic and probabilistic tracks.

Previous planning competitions have all been structured around a
number of planning domains such as Logistics, Freecell, and Airport,
with each planner being asked to solve a sequence of problems from
each domain. Previous (non-learning) planners in the competitions did
not attempt to leverage this structure, for example, by trying to
learn from previous problems in a domain to solve future problems in
the domain more effectively. The motivation for the learning track is
to encourage work on planning systems that do have such learning
capabilities.

The general structure of the learning track will be as follows. The
competitors will provide two programs to the organizers before the
competition begins: a learner and a planner. The competition will then
be run in two stages. First, there will be a learning stage, where the
learning programs will be provided with the domain definition and
example problems for each domain that will appear in the
competition. For each domain, the learning program will be given a
certain amount of learning time, after which it must output a
domain-specific control-knowledge file. Second, there will be an
evaluation stage, where, for each domain, the planner will be provided
with the appropriate domain-specific control-knowledge file and asked
to solve a sequence of test problems from that domain.

The organizers are not placing any constraints on what style of
learning approach might be used. For example, a system might utilize
statistical/inductive learning or purely deductive learning
techniques. In addition, the learning track provides a good venue for
entering approaches that might not traditionally be views as learning,
such as pure domain-analysis. For example, domain analysis could be
conducted during the learning period and the resulting knowledge used
during the evaluation period. Ultimately, we hope to see a wide
variety of approaches, that will help answer the following
questions. How can a planner best use a learning, or domain analysis,
period in order to improve future performance?

The learning track will run in the first half of 2008 and will
conclude together with ICAPS, in September 2008, in Sydney. It will be
organized by Alan Fern, Prasad Tadepalli, and Roni Khardon. Currently
we plan to focus on deterministic domains expressed using a subset of
the planning domain description language PDDL. The exact PDDL features
that will be supported depends largely on initial participant
feedback. Depending on interest we may also consider running a
probabilistic learning track.

All competitors must submit a 4-page paper describing their
planners. A booklet with the papers (possibly electronic) will be
distributed among the ICAPS-08 participants.

Finally, an important requirement for IPC-6 competitors is to give the
organizers the right to post the code of their planners on the
official IPC-6 web site.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Registration and Schedule

Potential participants are requested to send email to
wsccc@eecs.orst.edu expressing interest and providing information on
the Participant Interest Form on the web-site. Early expression of
interest will provide opportunity to help shape the structure of the
competition.

The final registration deadline is February 29, 2008. Each participant
should register by sending an email to wsccc@eecs.orst.edu including
the filled in registration form available from the competition web
site.

The tentative schedule of the competition activities are as follows:

     * January 31 '08: Definition of domain language (some subset of
                       PDDL) and evaluation schema

     * February 29 '08: Registration deadline

     * March 22 '08: Demo problems, supporting tools (syntax checker,
                     plan validator)

     * May 22 '08: Final versions of the planners and learners
                   submitted to the organizers with description abstract

     * July 1 '08: Deadline for the final version of the papers about
                   the competing planners

     * June-August '08: Collection and evaluation of the results

     * September '08: Announcement of the results and winners at ICAPS'08

Possible additional (intermediate) deadlines will be communicated to
the registered participants by the organizers.

We are looking forward to an exciting competition!

The organizers,

Alan Fern, Prasad Tadepalli, Roni Khardon

Our you can set the environment variable PYTHONUSERBASE to $HOME.

When it was filed, 'obvious' did not mean what you or I, as normal
human beings and programmers, think it means. So yes, this is
frivolous, but someone else could easily have filed it.

Given that someone else could easily have filed this and used it
against Google, I'm very hesitant to call them evil- patents are (at
this point) very much a nuclear weapon in the software industry, so
you're fairly irresponsible if you're *not* filing as many patents as
you can. Even Red Hat does it, FFS.

The evil companies (and I really don't know if Google is one of them
offhand) are the ones who are not aggressively lobbying for meaningful
patent reform. That is who you should condemn, not the ones filing the
patents (even if they are stupid.)

I absolutely love the Bird's Nest Stadium, it looks stunning at night and inside it is amazing. Swimming's Water Cube venue is equally wonderful and talking to the swimmers they all think it's terrific. Expect plenty of fast times to be set. One man sure to be setting them is American superstar Michael Phelps.  He is set to be the face of the Games as he goes for a record eight gold medals.  There is so much to look forward to from a British perspective. In track and field I'd love to see triple jumper Phillips Idowu and heptathlete Kelly Sotherton win gold and we have got real chances in sailing, rowing, boxing and cycling amongst others.  I saw diving prodigy Tom Daley at a reception at the British Embassy earlier this week.  So much media attention has been placed on the 14-year-old, but I told him, 'don't listen to anyone, have your own expectations and just enjoy it'. The expectation and pressure that sits on the shoulders of the Chinese team though is huge. I watched some of their gymnasts practising and they looked so nervous and were making mistakes.  I was told the other day that people are saying if 110m hurdler Liu Xiang doesn't win the gold medal everything he has achieved in his career won't be worth anything. They are putting so much pressure on their athletes, and to think Tim Henman thought he had it bad at Wimbledon! They not only want success, they expect success and they want to knock the USA off their usual spot at the top of the medals table. It's set to be a spectacular 16 days of action.

                              Call for Papers

               8th International Conference on Logic Programming
                       and Nonmonotonic Reasoning
                                 (LPNMR'05)
 
                         Diamante, Cosenza, Italy
                           September 5-8, 2005

                      http://www.mat.unical.it/lpnmr05/


LPNMR'05 is the eighth in the series of international meetings on logic
programming and nonmonotonic reasoning. Seven previous meetings were held
in Washington, D.C., (1991), in Lisbon, Portugal (1993), in Lexington,
Kentucky (1995), in Dagstuhl, Germany (1997), in El Paso, Texas (1999),
in Vienna, Austria (2001), and in Fort Lauderdale, Florida (2004).

LPNMR'05 will be organized by the Department of Mathematics of University
of Calabria (Italy), and will be co-located with the INFOMIX Workshop
on Data Integration.

The proceedings of the conference will be published by Springer - 
Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence series (to be verified).


AIMS AND SCOPE
--------------

LPNMR is a forum for exchanging ideas on declarative logic programming, 
nonmonotonic reasoning and knowledge representation. The aim of the conference 
is to facilitate interactions between researchers interested in the design 
and implementation of logic based programming languages  and database systems, 
and researchers who work in the areas of knowledge  representation and 
nonmonotonic reasoning. LPNMR strives to encompass these theoretical and 
exprimental studies  that lead to the construction of practical systems 
for declarative  programming and knowledge representation. 

Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original and unpublished 
research on nonmonotonic aspects of logic programming and knowledge 
representation. We particularly encourage papers on application of LPNMR 
techniques to build significant applications.

A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest includes: 

1. Development and mathematical studies of logical systems
   with nonmonotonic entailment relations:
     - Semantics of new and existing languages;
     - Relationships between formalisms;
     - Complexity and expressive power;
     - Development of inference algorithms and search heuristics for
       LPNMR systems;
     - Extensions of ''classical'' LPNMR languages by new logical
       connectives and new inference capabilities such as abduction,
       reasoning by cases, etc;
     - Updates and other operations on LPNMR systems;
     - Uncertainty in LPNMR systems.
 
2. Implementation of LPNMR systems: 
     -  system descriptions, comparisons, evaluations;
     -  LPNMR benchmarks.

3. Applications of LPNMR systems:
     - LPNMR languages and algorithms in planning, diagnosis,
       software engineering, decision making, and other domains;
     - Applications of LPNMR languages in Data Integration and Exchange 
       systems;
     - Methodology of representing knowledge in LPNMR languages:
       theory and practice;
     - Integration of LPNMR systems with other computational
       paradigms;
     - Embedded LPNMR systems: Systems using LPNMR subsystems.          


SYSTEM AND APPLICATION DEMONSTRATION TRACKS
-------------------------------------------

As part of the technical program, we also plan a special session devoted 
to presentations and demonstrations of implemented nonmonotonic reasoning 
systems. Systems and application demonstration tracks will be announced 
in a distinct call.

Yes, you can copy/mount the files directly into a database directory on
a target system, and the directory contains everything that you need for
that database.

*However*, you're not guaranteed structural integrity on the MySQL
datafiles unless you stop the database before copying them, and
similarly it's not a good idea to just copy files into the directory on
the target MySQL either without restarting it.

You can, however, use a 1-liner mysql commandline call to dump the
entire database to an  SQL backup textfile, and a similar 1-liner to cat
it back into the target database on the far side. This allows you to
move the data from instance to instance without restarting them.

Regards,

Vin

I am currently running SpamAssassin 3.1.9 and MIMEDefang 2.6.3.  I recently
attempted an upgrade of SpamAssassin to the latest version (3.2.4) and in a
matter of about 15 minutes, the load average on the server skyrocketed to
over 20 and continued to grow.  The output of the top command showed that
numerous mimedefang processes had been spawned and they all just sat there
eating up the CPU and memory.  I reverted back to SpamAssassin 3.1.9 and
everything returned to normal.  

In an attempt to troubleshoot this issue, I duplicated my
Sendmail+MIMEDefang+SpamAssassin configuration onto a test machine.  I have
been unsuccessful in getting this problem to occur on the test machine. 
However, any attempt to upgrade SpamAssassin on my production server results
in high load averages.

At this point, I'm at a stand still in terms of what the next step should be
in troubleshooting this problem.  I am unsure if this is a SpamAssassin
problem or MIMEDefang problem as both seem to be involved.    I have been
searching around on other forums and have not found anything.  Any
suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  

Please let me know if there are any configuration files I can post that will
help in narrowing this down further.

Thank you.

relay_transport is not an smtpd feature. It is implemented by the 
trivial-rewrite server.

One ugly but effective solution is:

/etc/postfix/master.cf:
    1.2.3.4:smtp  ... .. .. smtpd 
	-o content_filter=mailcat:

This will direct all incoming SMTP mail to the mailcat transport

It won't do anything for local submission or forwarding.

My view is that the notion of imprecise probabilities is not well-defined.
It seems that you are imagining something like, before the experiment is
performed, the probability distribution is drawn randomly from some set of
distributions, then the experiment is performed based on that distribution.
But it seems to me that these intermediary ""probabilities"" aren't really
probabilities then, they are model parameters. There will still be a final
distribution over the values of the outcome of the experiment, which in your
model is found by marginalizing over the ""random probabilities"".

To me, the essence of probability is that some event occurs according to a
fixed distribution. A probability distribution can't apply to only one
experiment. Whatever event that is being observed either will or will not
occur with some stationary distribution. If it does have a distribution,
then it is impossible to distinguish any particular generating sequence of
random variables. Any model that yields that final distribution when
marginalized is possible. You might be able to talk about the distribution
evolving in time.

Regarding your probability questions (c) and (d), I don't think you can
specify the marginal distributions of the ""probabilities,"" aij, in advance.
There might not be a joint distribution that satisfies those marginals, e.g.
if X takes values in {1,2,3}, the probabilities p1, p2, and p3 can't all be
in an interval above 0.5 for example.

It would be possible to find the joint distribution that results from
restricting the probabilities to certain (admissible) intervals. In the
uniform case, the joint density would occupy the intersection of a hypercube
with the simplex. Expectations would be calculated by integrating over this
polytope, normalizing by its volume. A weighted integration could be
performed in the triangular case. I think intersection of linear varieties
with hypercubes are called zonotopes, and there may be formulae for their
volumes.

Kind regards,

Jason

Subject: [UAI] Imprecise Probabilities--A simple and yet computationally
nontrivial problem



         Most real-world probabilities are imprecise. For this reason, as we
move further into the age of machine intelligence and mechanized
decision-making, the problem of how to deal with imprecise probabilities is
certain to grow in visibility and importance.

         A major contribution to the theory of imprecise probabilities was
Peter Walley's 1991 book ""Statistical Reasoning with Imprecise
Probabilities,"" London: Chapman and Hall. Since then, considerable progress
has been made. And yet, what is obvious is that the problem of computation
with imprecise probabilities is intrinsically complex and far from
definitive solution.

         As a case in point, I posted to the UAI list (September 22, 2005) a
seemingly simple problem which does not have a simple solution. In the
following, a broadened version of the problem is presented. The simplest
version is Problem (a). My perception is that even this simple problem is
computationally nontrivial. Do you have a simple solution? Do you have any
solutions to Problems (b), (c) and (d)?

Problem:
         X and Y are random variables taking values in the set (1, 2,
.,n). The entries in the joint probability matrix, P, are of the form
""approximately aij,"" where the aij take values in the unit interval and add
up to unity. What is the marginal probability distribution of X? Four
special cases: (a) ""approximately aij,"" is interpreted as an interval
centering on aij; (b) ""approximately aij,"" is interpreted as a triangular
fuzzy number centering on aij; (c) ""approximately aij,"" is interpreted as a
uniform probability distribution over an interval centering on aij; and (d)
""approximatelt aij,"" is interpreted as a triangular probability density
function centering on aij.

                   With warm regards to all

                          Lotfi

1st Call for Papers

IEEE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
Special Issue on Argumentation Technology

#########################################

Submission deadline: 2 Mar. 2007

A PDF version of this the call is available here:
http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/irahwan/docs/IEEE-IS-CFP.pdf

The theory of argumentation is a rich, interdisciplinary area of 
research lying across philosophy, communication studies, linguistics, 
and psychology. Over the last few years, formal models of argumentation 
have been gaining increasing importance in artificial intelligence, and 
have found a wide range of applications ranging from specifying 
semantics for logic programs, to natural language text generation, to 
supporting legal reasoning, to facilitating multiagent dialogue and 
negotiation.

Various forums have been dedicated to the theory of argumentation in AI, 
such as the

*   International Conference on Computational Models of Argument (COMMA 
2006)

*   Computational Models of Natural Argument (CMNA) workshop series

*   Argumentation in Multi-Agent Systems (ArgMAS 04, 05, 06) workshop series

However, no consolidated state-of-the-art survey on the practical 
applications of argumentation in AI exists.

This special issue of IEEE Intelligent Systems aims to report on the 
state of the art on the applications of argumentation in AI. We solicit 
original research papers on topics including, but not limited to,

*   Applications of argumentation in complex-systems engineering and design

*   Argument-based decision support systems

*   Argument extraction from real data

*   Argumentation in computer-supported collaborative work

*   Argumentation in natural language processing

*   E-democracy and e-government applications

*   Educational applications of argumentation

*   Intelligent tools for argument construction and analysis

*   Legal applications

*   Medical applications

*   Practical argument-based multiagent systems

*   Semantic Web applications

We’re especially interested in papers reporting on deployed systems or 
pilot systems that provide highly promising techniques and ideas. We’re 
also interested in surveys of specific areas of application, such as 
argument-based legal-decision support.

you what I need to do. Let's throw the whole shortcut idea out the
window and start from scratch.

My code generates a file, I want to open the directory (which is known)
containing that file and select it. Since I can open the directory with
os.startfile(), do I still need to get the hwnd of the explorer window
and get the listctrl etc., or is there a simpler way to select a file?

""Find Target"" just follows a shortcut and opens the directory containing

that shortcut.  The shell library has an API for fetching the target 
path from a shortcut file.  You could just pull the path from the 
shortcut, and startup a new Explorer in that directory.

Mousing over is really the only way.  If you don't get a chance to clean 
up after yourself, no one else can do it.

You're talking about a fairly serious design flaw here.  What is 
preventing you from shutting down in an orderly way?

Are your parents, siblings and friends all up in your face about the guy 
you're dating? Are they telling you he is not the one for you? That he is no 
good and you should not even entertain the idea of marrying him? Do you think 
they are just being a pain, or that they are jealous? O.K., enough with the

In FF your api is crystal perfect, however in IE7, with
autoplay and fadeout, and timer set on, it seems to fade out then skip abruptly

FileDownload steps on my builders, which work fine, only just one that
never ends.

This was happening in 0.7.4, and still happens in 0.7.6 after I upgraded
everything (Twisted 2.4.4, Linux master and slave).

I have tried to debug this for a while, and here's what I found:

The download on the slave seems to work fine, and the last _readBlock
reads 0 bytes:
2007/11/16 15:02 CST [Broker,client]
SlaveFileDownloadCommand._readBlock(): readlen=0
2007/11/16 15:02 CST [Broker,client] send a remote close

I see the close being called on the master, but nothing further happens.
For the other FileDownload steps, I normally see the 'step complete'
message in the log right after remote_close has been called, and the
builder then continues.

Any ideas what's going wrong? What in the code I should look at from there?

Well that's a shame (for me): it means that WMI is working
ok on your machine in general... although I'd have been
surprised if that weren't the case!

Just to narrow down, could you run these lines in the interpreter
to see if/where the error comes up:


import wmi
c = wmi.WMI ()
c.Win32_OperatingSystem ()

SPECIAL SESSION ON COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS FOR DEFENCE 

Session chair: Alex Ryan, DSTO 

The special Defence session on Complex Adaptive Systems is an extension of
the Defence Science and Technology Organization (DSTO) Complex Adaptive
Systems in Defence workshops. The DSTO workshops identify emerging
approaches to complex systems with potential defence applications. This is
achieved by fostering interactions between defence, academic and industrial
research sectors to provide collaboration opportunities that can strengthen
both the theory and application of complex systems science. The special
Defence session on Complex Systems promotes these objectives by providing a
refereed forum for novel approaches to complex systems in defence, and an
opportunity for wider interaction with the academic community. Authors
should mention at the time of submission if their papers are submitted to
this special session. All papers submitted to the special session will be
refereed in the same way as those submitted for the main stream. All papers
accepted in the special session will be included in the conference
proceedings.

I did 588 and 587 on AIX, on your IRC request. Do you need more?
For AIX readers: IBM's 'patch' does *not* apply them if the files
are read-only.

For sys.stderr it may make sense to override any error reporting
because of encoding problems. -0 on that.

For sys.stdout this doesn't make sense at all, since it hides encoding
errors for all applications using sys.stdout as piping mechanism.
-1 on that.

Both are really way beyond the scope of the PEP and I don't
really see the need for them. They also don't cover the cases
where you write the repr() to a log file, some stream or syslog.

I'd be +1 on making the error handling of sys.stdout and sys.stderr
user adjustable.

This is all very nice, but if that means that the whole Unicode
database has to be loaded every time the interpreter starts up
as you indicated on the ticket, them I'm firmly -1 against that.

We've taken great care *not* to do this in Py2.x by moving
the database to a module that's imported only when needed.
It would be really silly to do this now, just to get some
Unicode repr() processed.

BTW, I'm sure it's possible to break down the above into a set of
ranges and switch cases that are easy to test without having to
lookup code points in the database. Even if you do end up using
the database, it should only be imported if the repr() really
does not need to lookup code points outside the Latin-1 range.

I'm not sure what you are saying here.

I proposed to make the Unicode repr() output a regular encoding
that's being implemented by a codec. You could then easily
change the encoding to whatever you need for your application
or console.

Why Service Consumers and Service Providers Should Never Directly Communicate
Document ID: ZAPFLASH-2008228 | Document Type: ZapFlash
By: Ronald Schmelzer
Posted: Feb. 28, 2008
Edward R. Murrow once said, People say conversation is a lost art; how often I have wished it were. How true it is in the vendor and media-spun world of IT and even more so in the case of SOA. Many people think they are doing or talking about Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), but most of the time theyre really doing Web Services Integration (WSI), developing Just a Bunch of Web Services (JBOWS), or even just point-to-point XML (what many would like to call REST, but even in most cases is not even truly Representational State Transfer [REST], which is also an architectural form). Even after 8 years of evangelism, research, advisory, and deep consulting, were still finding a large percentage of so-called enterprise architects pursuing SOA projects as if they were point-to-point integration projects. 

Weve discussed many times from an economic, technical, architectural, and philosophical perspective the problem with not understanding that SOA is an architectural concept, so I wont bore or nag you further in understanding that SOA is not just another name for integration. However, we need to crack this nut and crack it definitively if this industry is to make progress from its current inefficient, ineffective, unpredictable, overly-expensive, overly-complex, and rudimentary form to the predictable, reliable, cost-effective, disciplined, and easily measured part of the business organization that we know it should be. 

While weve made our pleas to the business, architectural, and process-driven parts of the organization and to vendors in previous ZapFlashes, we want to focus this ZapFlash on where the problem specifically lies: within the IT organization, and specifically the part that concerns themselves with so-called integration issues. Folks (and Im speaking directly to you integration-centric techies), you are getting in the way of making SOA a success probably due to your own misunderstandings and misconceptions of how SOA should work. And to correct your misunderstanding, I need to speak your language: the language of integration technology.

The Problem of Service Consumer to Service Provider Communication
In typical integration environments, youre primarily concerned with the movement of data or the amalgamation of business logic to achieve a specific task. In that vein, most integration developers think about inputs (gazintas), outputs (gazattas), transfer, and transformation. That is, they think about how theyre going to get data or application functionality out of one system, how theyll get it into another system, the mechanism theyll use to get that information or functionality from one place to another, and then what they need to do with it while its en-route to transform it from one format, protocol, context, process, or policy into another. So, while architects are chemists  that is, scientists who are trying to understand a system and how it can all be put together, integration developers are chemical engineers  focusing on just the mechanisms of transformation.

>From this integration-centric mentality, most integration developers see the concept of the Service as just another means of gazinta or gazatta. That means these integration-heads need to find something else to do transfer and transformation. Vendors to the rescue! Most vendors responded to this desire by simply dusting off their existing integration middleware. End-users responded easily to this insignificant change and voila, now they have transfer and transform that can deal with their Service-based gazintas/gazattas. But does this make SOA? Oh no, no, no. But weve already beaten you on the head with that a million times. So, lets take a different tack. The reason why this approach is wrong is because Services Consumers (what you might think of as a gazinta) should never communicate directly to Service Providers (what you might erroneously think is a gazatta). 

Why? First, the main concept of SOA is that we want to deal with frequent and unpredictable change by constructing an architectural model, discipline, and abstraction that loosely-couples the providers of capability from the consumers of capability in an environment of continuous heterogeneity. This means that we have to somehow develop capabilities without the knowledge of how they might be used.  As we delved into the Seven Aspects of Loose Coupling in a previous ZapFlash, this means that we need to have significant variability at a variety of aspects including the implementation, infrastructure, contract, process, policy, data schema, and semantic aspects. Having this variability allows companies to have stability in their business and IT even though the IT and business continue to change. Agility, predictability, reliability, visibility, and cost-effectiveness all become that much more realistic when we can achieve that sort of abstraction.

But to achieve that abstraction means that we cant afford things to break when things change. Lots of things change in an IT or business environment: location and availability of services, versioning of Service implementations and contracts, changes to business processes and policies, new or changing requirements for reporting, visibility, and control, and of course the need for new capabilities to solve emerging business problems or capitalize on new business opportunities. However, if you think that a Service is just an API, then all hell breaks loose when you try to connect a Service Consumer directly to a Service Provider. What if the provider moves? What if the Service contract changes? What if the provider is no longer available? What if you now need a new communication mechanism or change to a data schema? 

The first knee-jerk reaction to this complexity by most integration architects is to put some piece of technology between the Service consumers and providers to ameliorate this problem. The impulse is correct: you cant have direct communication if you want to have variability. However, the execution is all wrong. If you are relying on black-box, and often proprietary, technology to do the heavy lifting of managing Service communication differences youll simply shift all the complexity and work from the end-points (the Services) to an increasingly more complex, expensive, and brittle middle point. Welcome to EAI 2.0, the secret and unpublicized real name for most so-called Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) products  or at least the way that many are using them. 

(Re)Introducing the Service Proxy
So, if reworked middleware isnt the solution, what is? Well, of course the answer is architecture. But thats too pat of an answer, so to speak again in the parlance of integration developers, lets explore how a system would be designed if you cant count on any particular vendors solution to be in the middle to make it all work.

Lets say you want to build a Service Consumer to consume or compose some functionality, but you dont know where that functionality is or even how to communicate with it. There are at least three ways of handling this particular challenge. First, you can talk to a proxy (or broker or intermediary) in a language that you do understand and thats in a location that you already know and send a request to this proxy that will act on the behalf of the Consumer. This is the envelope within an envelope concept. Basically, you enclose a message to deliver to someone whom you know, but dont know where they are, within an envelope that is addressed to a party that you do know. That party then opens the envelope and addresses the internal envelope to the end recipient based on a look-up of some sort. This approach simplifies the problem of the Service consumer having to know about changes since they just need to know about the proxy and the end-recipient. From a technology perspective, the use of WS-Addressing simplifies this approach. In essence, a Service consumer just needs to know the WS-Address of a Provider and hand that to a Service proxy to resolve and deliver.

Weve discussed this concept of the Service Intermediary before. The problem with this approach is that the Service proxy still needs to find a way to deliver the message, and if the proxy contains all the rules internally in the black-box, we have the same problem we have with EAI 2.0-style ESB solutions. This is where the registry steps in. Service proxies should not store their own rules, but rather get all their routing, location, and policy-based binding rules from a central system of record. In SOA, this is the role of the registry. Proxies can cache the results of registry look-ups for performance enhancement, but the metadata themselves should come from the registry.

So, registry-configured Service proxies solve many of the problems of Service communication, but it still leaves open the problem of the connection between the Service consumer and the Service proxy. What if the proxies move or are unavailable? And how do Service consumers find out about the Service proxy in the first place? The answer to this challenge is the use of registry-based late binding. In this scenario, the Service consumer pings the registry to find out where the proxy is, perhaps based on where the Service consumer is currently located and with what protocols it can communicate. One would think that we can make the Service consumer directly bind to a Service provider after finding its metadata in the registry, but that would be a mistake. The problem is that if the Service provider is using some alternate protocol or is in some location that the Service consumer cant reach, well have a communications problem. So, even in the case where were discovering metadata in a registry, we still dont want direct communication between a Service consumer and provider.

Therefore, the optimal solution here is to use registry-based late-binding to help the Service consumers find proxies and also to help them resolve Service providers to WS-Addresses. Then, the Service consumer communicates with a proxy, providing the WS-Address and required metadata for communication. This allows Service consumers to be quite simple, leveraging a network of distributed, and most likely heterogeneous, Service proxies doing the communication on behalf of Service consumers. In this scenario, companies can implement Service proxies using and mixing a wide range of technologies and approaches including hardware-based network intermediaries, software proxies, and even agents that reside on Service consumer end-points.

Finally, in the above scenario, wheres the ESB? Nowhere, unless you believe that the ESB is a pattern and not a product (as IBM once espoused). Is the ESB needed? Not necessarily. Will it make you feel better to buy one anyways? Maybe. Of course, what are these proxies? Surely ESB vendors will want to have you believe that their products can be used as proxies in this configuration, and thats absolutely true. They certainly can. The point is not that ESB's can't make good proxies. They certainly can, and I want to specifically point that out. But you can also get away with not using one or using your existing infrastructure and it will all still work. The sad truth is that most integration architects are not using ESBs as Service proxies, but rather as EAI 2.0 hub-and-spoke or message-bus brokers that facilitate Web Services Integration, not SOA. 

The ZapThink Take
If you think about it, weve already implemented complex, heterogeneous networks in this fashion before. Computers leverage DHCP, gateways, and routers to do networking in a way thats far superior to direct, point-to-point IP communications. And this is basically what were saying about Service communication. Understanding this is a realization that this is not a technology issue, but an architectural one.

To get SOA, you have to get it in your head that the Service concept is an abstraction, not an interface. Once you understand the abstraction, then it will all become that much clearer. So, you need to do some soul-searching with regards to your SOA initiative. Are you doing Web Services Integration (WSI) with EAI 2.0, or have you really changed your architecture to become Service-oriented in an environment of heterogeneity and continuous change? If you are doing WSI on EAI 2.0, you will find yourself continuously solving the same problems. With SOA, you will find yourself able to continuously solve new problems.

Good afternoon.   We have had only a few responses to this Cultureflow opportunity.   We need at least 16 per class for Cultureflow to make this work. Currently we have responses as per below.

6 from Palmerton North
6 from Albany
(We do have a full class for Wellington)
I will forward numbers to Cultureflow mid-week, so if any further responses could come to me within the next day or two, this would work well..

Would secretaries please pass this message on to your staff mailing lists.


CADeL have been offered the following Training Programme with Cultureflow.

Cultureflow is a learning system designed to introduce all intrigued by our country's culture to Te Ao M�ori - The Maori worldview.  A systemized approach to learning using interactive software, online, audio and written tools, reinforced through weekly contact with qualified tutors.   Our programmes aim to provide information for the absolute beginner as well as the more dedicated.  Cultureflow promotes learning through a disciplined structure within an easy going environment.

What programmes do we offer in 2008?

*       Eyespeak M�ori - a two week pronunciation course, facilitated with software reinforcement.  Eyespeak M�ori is the first M�ori language pronunciation software tool of its kind.  Through practice with Eyespeak M�ori you will be confident pronouncing M�ori names, words and phrases.
*       Outline of Eyespeak Maori programme - Eyespeak Maori has been designed to assist improve basic pronunciation of Reo Maori via interactive software and face to face tutoring.  What you practice in class, can be reinforced at home or at work via a software tool that can measure your accuracy and provide feedback in a written report.  Now you can see and hear the difference between your attempts and those of a native speaker.  The tool provides 3000 different words in te reo Maori that you can practice on.
*       Learning Outcomes - Upon achieving a 70% pass in over 1200 of the words on the tool, Cultureflow will consider you a graduate in basic pronunciation of Reo Maori.  This is contributable toward a short course certificate from UCOL, the Certificate in Maori studies from Waiariki Institute of Technology, or the Public Sector Maori manager's certificate with PSITO.
*       Cultureflow Intro - a four week programme introducing the learner to Reo and Tikanga Maori.
*       Outline of Cultureflow Intro programme - Cultureflow Intro promises the learner the following:
-       introduction to formal and informal greetings in Maori
-       introduction to Mihimihi
-       Introduction to discussions on Tikanga on the marae, and Maori world view.
-       Accepted theories on Maori migration journey
-       Treaty of Waitangi historical analysis and contemporary application
Learning Outcomes - Upon successful completion of the 45 minute assessment at the end of the programme, Cultureflow will certify you a graduate of the Cultureflow Intro programme.  This certification will also provide you with a short course certificate from UCOL.  It is also contributable toward the Certificate in Maori studies from Waiariki Institute of Technology.

What if I've already completed Cultureflow Te Kete Tuatahi?

This is a prime opportunity to upskill and reinforce the learning you have achieved.  As there are so few opportunities for you to practice the learning, the concept of Tuakana - Teina  may enhance the classroom environment.  I encourage you to take advantage of this short 6 week training opportunity.

Is there an enrolment process?

Yes, all interested will be asked to email: hjvps@cultureflow.co.nz . At the end of each week Cultureflow admin will send out a pdf UCOL form for you to fill in. Cultureflow admin will prompt you the following week to send the form with appropriate id back into our office. Final enrolments will be collated week ending 25th April 2008.

When will training begin?

Week beginning May 12th at Massey campuses around the country.

When will training conclude?

Week beginning June 16th at Massey campuses around the country

If we are interested in learning more can we enrol into another programme?

Yes.  Te Kete Tuatahi will be delivered for those interested in taking things a step further from July 1st 2008.




This is a six-week programme.
Duration 1.5 hrs per day, one day per week for six weeks. Courses will commence Week beginning 12 May.

There is a UCOL enrolment process.

Expressions of interest to mailto:q.anpjb@massey.ac.nz in  the first instance, then CultureFlow will be advised of your interest and take over the enrolment process themselves.

Kind regards to all.

Benoit Sigoure <lwzbp@lrde.epita.fr>,stfrkmtt-qdjej@lists.sourceforge.net,"Fri, 08 Aug 2008 09:33:53 +0100",[Buildbot-devel] [PATCH 04/11] Redirect to the waterfall with the	Ping/Start Build/Stop Builder buttons.,"	I find this much more convenient than being sent back to the index
	page.  When you Ping/Start/Stop a build, the first thing you want to
	see is whether the ping worked or whether the build properly started
	is staying green or whether builder really stopped.  Or so I think.
	* buildbot/status/web/build.py (StatusResourceBuild.stop),
	* buildbot/status/web/builder.py (StatusResourceBuilder.force)
	(StatusResourceBuilder.ping): Adjust the Redirect.

Attached is a developer release of CPANPLUS::Dist::Build with all your
patches applied. Could you (and Craig, if you're reading this ;) take
a look at this release and let me know if all tests pass?

If so, Ken and I can do a new release and integrate it into Core.

Back to business
    Let's face it. Few people like going to work, but most of us have to do it. Thanks to the Web and lots and lots of microchips, we can work from almost anywhere these days. But it can still be tedious and unproductive without the right tools. This month's Living With Technology gives you productivity tips and shows you the best tools to use, plus we look at how Web sites may be affecting boxed software giants like Microsoft.

Great!  Once you've settled in with your changes let me know and I'll help with doing the necessary things on the Windows-side to set up the bsddb46.vcproj and switching the build to use that.

Maybe we shouldn't be so worried about deprecation.  Py3 is a clean

Torsten, I agree.  Let's just rename ugettext() to gettext() and have  
it return unicodes.  That's the cleanest API we can do for Python.

Outlook uses base64 quite often when the sender uses UTF8.  I'm sure it
can be changed, but I see HTML+UTF8 and base64 quite frequently from
e.g. EU staff. 
The fact that the itjobboard email was in base64 AND ISO-8859-1 makes it
odd, though.

Establishing a company in Vancouver may not be as attractive now as  
it was a few years ago, considering that CAD/USD has followed CHF/ 
USD, EUR/USD, or pretty much */USD, and appears to have passed  
parity.  But if you all are interested in that route, BC probably  
still has an allocation of permits that they can fast-track past Ottawa.

(I may be overly optimistic; I'd thought things were getting better  
in the States.  If not, it might be worth recalling that Anne Frank's  
father had both the sense to think that things were getting weird in  
Germany, and the misfortune to decide on moving to an adjacent  
country.  There is an old joke:

This still fails with perl5.10.0 RC1. 

For a workaround, throw something into your code which triggers
loading of some unicode-related .pl files (utf8_heavy.pl,
unicore/To/Fold.pl etc.) at compile time, e.g. with

    qr{\\x{0100}}i;

Note that the unicode codepoint must be 0x100 or higher.

Hash: SHA1

I'm happy to announce that we now have available for public  
consumption, the Python source code for 2.5, 2.6 and 3.0 available  
under the Bazaar distributed version control system.

The current Subversion repository is still the master copy of the  
source code.  We have not made a decision to move to Bazaar  
officially, nor have we made a decision to even move off of  
Subversion.  We're making these branches available exactly so that  
you, the Python developer community, can kick the tires and see if it  
makes sense to move to a different vcs.  Nothing will happen until  
after the Python 2.6/3.0 releases anyway.

All the gory details are documented here:

     http://www.python.org/dev/bazaar

These branches are available both for core Python developers with  
commit privileges, and the wider world of developers without commit  
privileges.  It's this latter group that I think will find the most  
compelling immediate benefit from using Bazaar, because they will no  
longer need to maintain their own changes using a mass of patch files.

For more information on Bazaar in general, see:

     http://bazaar-vcs.org

You will probably be most interested in the Bazaar mirrors of the  
Subversion master repository.  We have a cron job that updates Bazaar  
from Subversion every 15 minutes.  It is also possible to push changes  
made in your Bazaar branches into the Subversion master, so you can  
keep reasonably up-to-date and interact with the Python source code  
solely via Bazaar.

Please let me know if you have any questions or anything in the docs  
referenced above aren't clear.  I know I need to document the Bazaar- 
 >Subversion workflow in more detail.

Huge thanks go out especially to Thomas Wouters who sprinted with me  
yesterday on getting the whole infrastructure up and running.  Thanks  
also to Martin v. Loewis, Sean Reifschneider, and the folks here at  
Pycon from the Bazaar project, Ian, Andrew, John, and Edwin.

Enjoy,
- -Barry

Even when the code is removed it will still be in the svn history so
you should be able to grab it easily.

I tried IBB which supposedly worked in my area - it didnt so it just brought 
it back.  Clearwire definitely does work but when you order you have to 
enter a billing address and if they think that area is not covered they wont 
allow you to buy!! So clearwire works - they just wont sell it to me :)

Typically yes.  Usually 20-40 min after running on full load.  Or after
50-60 min with 3/4 load.

I've asked Gigabyte if the third temp temperature sensor is the
Northbridge, but they haven't replied yet.  I suspect it's the
Northbridge, as the other two are almost certainly system and CPU temp.  

The CPU temp has hit a max of 60-62 degrees, which according to AMD is
fine.  AMD has also confirmed (by email) that the heatsink+fan that
came with the ""boxed"" CPU is sufficient for CPU-cooling under full
load. 

If it's the Northbridge getting too hot, it's still likely Gigabytes
problem.  Maybe the heatpipe/sink was poorly mounted or assembled.  I
don't see much chance of improving on the cooling for the Northbridge. 

I should be getting a new board some time next week - just sent off the
bother one yesterday.

           Summary: A missing or failed eval rule function can mistakenly
                    count as a rule hit
           Product: Spamassassin
           Version: 3.2.4
          Platform: All
        OS/Version: All
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
          Priority: P5
         Component: Libraries
        AssignedTo: xrh@spamassassin.apache.org
        ReportedBy: aznd.rumncmpg@gvc.ceas-challenge.cc


A rule specifying an eval function which does not exist (or dies)
does not clear a $result variable, so the rule would count
as a hit if a previous eval rule fired.

The error does get reported as a 'warn:', although few would
notice, but the result is still wrong. E.g.:
  [76898] dbg: rules: ran eval rule XXX ======> got hit (1)
  [76898] warn: rules: failed to run XXX test, skipping:
  [76898] warn:  (Can't locate object method ""check_xxx""
    via package ""Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus ... )

This can happen if for example a rule from a new version is used
with SpamAssassin code from an earlier version, or if there is a
typo in eval function name in the rule specification, or if
the function dies for some reason.

Problem was reported by Michael Scheidell.

Wow, I'm adding that to my list of things I never dreamed Subversion

I just tried it, and although it works, I get this output:

Add me as someone else who would be very keen on the source RPMS. RHEL4
is well behind Postfix versions at present, and we also have stupid
policies about building from source (ie. I'm allowed to build from an
SRPM, but I have to wait on our platform administrators to get any
source installs done... even when the servers I administer exclusively
run Postfix, and Postfix is my responsibility).

It appears to me you have just posted the body text for these spams.  Much 
of the spam catching is done off of the header information, so knowing that 
would help.

Also, knowing which tests did and didn't hit on your system would give us an 
idea what you might be missing.

That said, do you use the SARE rules?  There are a number of rules there 
that help catch 419's.

I don't think you can measure true rms with a coil and needle. :-?

FROM THE EDITOR



Mobile devices of the future -- more than just a smartphone
[Kate Dostart, Associate Editor]
bfzarlxu@techtarget.com

  My drama with finding a new phone continues -- in part because I've been hesitant to commit to a phone I don't love, and in part because I've been told that my old dual analog-digital phone is going to be shut off soon, so now I must upgrade.

Other than the expensive BlackBerry Pearl  I wish I didn't have to pay tons of money or renew my contract to get, I finally found the perfect device -- well, maybe. And no, it's not the tattoo phone!

It's Nokia's new concept, the Morph. Maybe you've heard of it, maybe you haven't. But this phone is amazing, and I'm in love. The only problem is, I'm eleven years too early for it.

Optimizing on nanotechnology, the device was first offered for viewing last month in conjunction with Museum of Modern Art's ""Design and the Elastic Mind"" exhibition. The Morph bends, stretches, folds and twists -- think Stretch Armstrong.

In addition to all that, this device will supposedly be the ultimate all-in-one-device. It can be shaped to fit your wrist like a watch or bracelet. Unfold it and it becomes a camera or, oddly enough, a device that can apparently detect whether your apple is at premium ripeness.


The device is theoretically unbreakable and self-cleaning because of its use of nanotechnology. It's also self-charging -- simply having the device out in the sun, even if it's in use, means its recharging as the entire device acts as a solar panel. That's a convenient truth for anyone who hates to carry around extra batteries or cable wall re-chargers. 

But outside how cool this future device is, one has to wonder, with mobile devices like BlackBerrys and Palms already so integral to so many people's lives, what a device like this might mean to how everyone functions. 

The Apple iPhone is already disrupting trends with its crossover appeal to both the consumer and the business user. While phones specifically designed for children haven't been much more than a niche market, would something like the Morph change that? 

Could a device like the Morph become an integral element to our daily lives -- a required device for school children, the ultimate clothing accessory for teenagers, the best business tool for the corporate worker and the most important device to pack for the traveler?

Nokia reports that the Morph, still more in the research rather than the development phase with full-time collaborating University of Cambridge researchers, is not expected to be ready for the market for another eleven years. So one wonders  whether, by then, we'll all just have microchips implanted into our wrists that can project holograms and do everything but the shape-shifting that the Morph is being designed to do.

But, if a cyborg comes back from eleven years in the future (though hopefully not after some Judgment Day) to save me from my own cell phone drama, I won't turn down the Morph.

Hasta la vista, baby!

Strange, lsusb is showing the device, but fdisk is showing nothing (I

Note, there's not any reference to 2.2.10* there.....all the openSUSE 
sites only refer to 2.2.8*. 2.2.10* SHOULD be available from the 
openSUSE.org site so it is shown for everyone when checking for updates. 
Version 2.2.10* is what someone listed here yesterday as the new release.

That was kind of what I was worrying about. I didn't know that they had to be
unique tokens. I just thought that the sheer volume of this Russian spam would
""push out"" all the other stuff.

A very helpful response. I really appreciate your input.

What I should have made clearer in my original mail is that almost all (in
fact I think *all*) this type of spam is being caught. Much of it even before
it gets into SA (with a procmail recipe).

My concern stems from the fact that I am thinking of /dev/null[ing] these
spams now that I am happy that there are no FPs from the procmail recipe. Would
the sudden absence of Russian spam leave the normal spam less heavily
weighted? I guess from what you said that it shouldn't be a problem. In any
case, the Bayes will soon put itself right over time (wouldn't it?).

Thanks again for your help, and to all the others who have commented on this
thread both on and off list...

More tests are probably needed in filespec.t of course.

I was concentrating on getting the final part of the symbolic links in. 
  It was not until recently that I realized we needed a vms_rename() 
routine in addition to a vms_realpath() and also that the vms_realpath() 
could be made to work with any version of VMS.

Some PEPs (252/253 come to mind) already carry such warnings. The 
wording in those two PEPs suggests that this warning was added by the 
PEP editors after the fact:

[Editor's note: the ideas described in this PEP have been incorporated 
   into Python.  The PEP no longer accurately describes the implementation.]

In other cases we have gone back and fixed the PEP to match the 
implementation (e.g. PEP 343 was updated to reflect changes that 
happened prior to 2.5 release).

Cheers,
Nick.

Use a content_filter that allows you to bypass filtering for 
individual users, such as amavisd-new.

Thanks.  I checked out, made a branch named test3, changed Makefile.pre.in
to have a test3 target, checked it in, then tried to push it:

    % pwd
    /Users/skip/src/python-bzr/test3
    % bzr push bzr+ssh://nqxlakxov@code.python.org/python/users/skip/test3
    bzr: ERROR: Parent directory of bzr+ssh://nqxlakxov@code.python.org/python/users/skip/test3 does not exist.
    You may supply --create-prefix to create all leading parent directories.

Did I misread the directions or do I really need the --create-prefix arg?

Skip

12-line snippet becomes 30-line one.

On the other side, there's no other obvious solution, so let it be as it goes. The only hope that damage is limited :)

That's okay if the objects are strings, but what about
non-string objects that contain strings?

We'd need another protocol, such as __unirep__.

Actually the hash of the mbox *URI*, so it's ""mailto:""+email address
(I got caught out by this last time).

btw, the FOAF spec has a handy link to a list of sha1 generators:

Darren Foo <niykcfjqc@yahoo.com>,fxgmqwjn@triptracker.net,"Thu, 07 Aug 2008 22:02:07 -0700",Great Site,"Hi,

I'd just like to say I've been searching high and low for a website like the new triptracker.net. I'm going on a trip to Italy and France and will be bringing my GPS logger to track our every steps. The interface and features have most of what I've been looking in a trip compilation site. I'll be leaving in a week's time and hope to be able to use triptracker.net for my trip. I have the following requests however:

1. unlisted public trips or googlemaps like links to private trips (I already mentioned this in the Idea forum)
2. change the UI so that when you click on a picture, it goes to the picture/waypoint/mini-slideshow view instead of just large view of picture. If I wanted just a large view of a picture I'd use flickr/picasa, etc
3. not too important, but perhaps you could interface into flickr or picasaweb  in order to lessen the storage burden (200meg currently)

Thanks again for the great site!

Darren Foo

If it's sporadic, that's not a problem. SA tried to get a read-write 
lock on the bayes DB, presumably for autolearning or autoexpiry, but 
some other SA instance may have had it.

Rather than block your mail queue, SA gave up.

This is only a problem if it happens *every* time SA tries to autolearn, 
in which case your rights aren't set up to allow writing of the files, 
only reading.

no. That would be caused by a timeout or over-sized message that didn't

Not Linux fault. The battery must be too small. It should have been 
designed for 8 to 10hrs. It shouldn't need any power management bar 
turning of the backlight or screen altogether if desired.

I have two laptops, one with Ubuntu and an older one with XP and VMware 
to run 3 versions of Linux. I have all power management turned off on XP 
(for performance) and get over 2hrs.  However  it  does drop from 
1800MHz to 1200MHz on  battery  or on a  70W PSU. You only get 1800MHz 
on 90W PSU. This is a BIOS feature. Inspiron 8200 1600x1200 screen, 120G 
drive, 768M RAM and P4 desktop CPU. If I dim display and set HD Driver 
to power down I get almost 3 hrs.

It's Flash memory. No disk. A lot of Flash based embedded CPU devices 
only have 4M Flash. yes Four Megabyte and run Linux. For a decent ARM 
based equivalent to Eeee PC, 1G would be fine. 4G is not bad for Linux 
x86. I used to install RH6 on 2G disks.

I built an ARM based 320x240 touchscreen and with 2 x small LiPoly  ipod 
2200mA cells, 5Mbps Mobile Internet and NO power management I get nearly 
4 hrs. (Linux)

I fitted 9.8V worth of NiMH AA cells to a MIPS based Router and with 
WiFi and Mobile Internet Modem @ 5Mbps I got 4hrs 15min regularly. (Linux)

So yes the 3.5hrs on this class low power optimised CPU  is poor. 
Obviously the battery needs to be 3 times bigger.

but I'm a bear
of little brain and am not understanding the migration path.  The
whole use of the ""2to3""
tools seems like an abrupt hack.  It is workable, but causes a serious
plan for near term
2.x to 3.x migration.   I'd like to present a different view.  Instead
of just yelling how it
must be wrong, consider it.  It's not far from the current migration
path and is less rocky.

Moving from 2.6 to 3.0 appears to encompass the following major tasks,
and some minor
ones:

1.  Change of Unadorned strings from default 'b' to default like the
(now illegal)  'u'
2.  Changed print becomes a function
3.  Changed meaning of keys(), items(), and values() changed
4.  Removed default ordering operators, string exceptions, old classes, etc.
5.  Changed repr() for Long.
6.  Completely predictable syntax modifications for Raise, Catch, etc.
etc., etc.

This is a lot for my head, and even a tool to translate is going to
cause odd warnings and
syntax errors everywhere.  It's especially hard as the advantages to
using 3.x are not
immediately realized upon conversion.

Now, for me this is (hopefully) academic:  I'm hoping not to port BLs
(metric) of code.  Still,
my consideration for programmers  would much prefer this sequence that
could, with changes
to 2.6, be done one module at a time in a way that converted and
unconverted code could live
side by side.  Over time, more of the transitional elements would be
'required' in my  build
environment.  That is, I would want to make my changes gradually and
have a reasonable
expectation that the first time I ran 2to3 would also be my last.

The biggest and most thoughtful cost is carefully looking at every
single string in my application
and deciding if it should be bytes or unicode, and adding the 'b' or
'u' adornment appropriately.
This would take an immense amount of time,  requiring rethinking APIs,
duplicating modules
when needing both byte and unicode processing, etc.  It's something to
do 'later'.  I expect a
transition period of adorning the strings whenever working on the code
anyway.  Eventually, I
would enable the Python warning about unadorned strings to catch the
last cases and times I
pull executable code from a file, database, or socket.

I would start banning deprecated and changed names, e.g., keys(),
range(), input() and the like.
When it makes sense,  I might use iter_keys(), xrange(), or
raw_input().  When it doesn't, I would
explicitly call functions,  not use idioms, to perform the old tasks:
range_as_list() or
input_with_eval().   Again the pattern of a period of  gradual change,
then pulling  the compiler
switch to warn about old usage.

I would start using the handy new printing function, named print3(),
instead of the print
statement.

Then I might, one day, switch to running 2.6 in the mode that warns
about old style classes,
default comparators, string  exceptions, and the like.   Likely, I
would use the fine grained control
to turn those warnings on one at a time over a  period of weeks or months.

Once there, I could confidently run 2to3 to build a 3.x version.  I
would do the same amount of
work, but spread my risk along a much longer schedule with more
options.  I would save time by
using serendipity when already maintaining code.   My 2.6 version
would always interact correctly
between modules which have been upgraded and those that have not.

In many ways, I'm not saying anything new.  Without fine grained
control in Python, I would expect
coders to start running the ""-3"" option or running ""2to3"" occasionally
to see what would need to
be fixed later in the module which has just been opened up.   With the
fine grained control, this
could be managed.   About 80% of the way could be done by judicial
control of static analyzers,
such as PyChecker or PyLInt.  100% would require options in Python.

Overall, the 2.x to 3.x transition needs to be fairly painless.  The
only immediate features for
developers are better unicode processing.  The other features are all
items that will be in 2.6
eventually, or have yet to be shown as really useful.    In a perfect
world, the gradual transition
looks like the more like the transition of C code to ANSI-C code to
ANSI-C compiled in a C++
compiler and less like the Perl leaps between version.

Once ready, the transition from 2.7 to 3.0 would be mechanical.

Ah, so the first disk, as defined by the BIOS, may not be the one 
which I'd call first, the Master Disk at the end of the primary flat 
cable.

In my system, without RAID, there is no ambiguity which one is first, 
it has WinME and YaST Partitioner lists it as hda (SuSE 10.2) or sda 
(10.3).

Next week I get my hands on the system with 2 disks in RAID 1 for 
WinXP and a third disk with a SuSE partition. Then I can see which 
one is defined first by the BIOS and how YaST Partitioner calls it.

actually applied it on his job. A question then came up. Where has it 
been successfully applied in real life problems? Although it's been 
around my whole life (at least since Jimmy Savage's book in 1954), I 
actually am aware of few real applications. There are a lot of 
publications that discuss problems that look real (e.g. Clemen's 
book), but is any of this real? Did Penzoil really analyze the 
problem as Clemen describes? Of course sitting in my `ivory tower' I 
would not know what goes on in corporate America, etc. So I would be 
curious to learn of any real applications of decision analysis, 
especially ones that are published. This could be in an expert system 
(that people use) or to make a one time decision.

******************************************************************************


The capability of reasoning with uncertain and/or incomplete
information is a crucial feature both of human and machine
intelligence. The Special Track on Uncertain Reasoning at the
Eighteenth International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research
Symposium (FLAIRS) Conference seeks to bring together researchers
working on broad issues related to reasoning under uncertainty. This
track was started in 1996 and has become an annual event at FLAIRS. In
2003 the track was merged with the Special Track on Imprecise and
Indeterminate Probabilities.

Papers on all aspects of uncertain reasoning and imprecise probabilities
are solicited.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Uncertain reasoning and databases
* Uncertain reasoning formalisms, calculi and methodologies
* Reasoning with probability, possibility, fuzzy logic, belief functions,
  argumentation, rough sets, and probability logics
* Modelling and reasoning using imprecise and indeterminate information,
* using for instance: Choquet capacities, comparative orderings, convex
sets of measures,
  and interval-valued probabilities
* Exact, approximate and qualitative uncertain reasoning
* Nonmonotonic reasoning and belief revision
* Multi-agent uncertain reasoning and decision making
* Decision-theoretic planning and Markov decision process
* Temporal reasoning and uncertainty
* Construction of models from elicitation, data mining and knowledge
discovery
* Uncertain reasoning in information retrieval, filtering, fusion,
diagnosis,
  prediction, and situation assessment
* Practical applications of uncertain reasoning


Paper Submission and Publication
- ---------------------------------
Paper format and submission details are available at
http://earth.cs.ccsu.edu/~flairs/submission.html

Thank you for your most valuable contribution.

Yes, we've been through this before. However, it seems you still don't
understand. There IS NO negated counterpart to ok_locales. Also, this is
not about languages, but character sets -- and there are exactly 6. So,
listing all but one in this context doesn't seem to be asking too much.

Instead of ranting, just try to understand ok_locales as an option to
list all character sets you can read. For most people, this boils down
to one or two anyway. Thus, the general usecase is to list just these.

Also, the OP specifically asked to catch Russian only. Listing 5 locales
is the only way to do this currently. If you know about a better way,
please let me know.

Otherwise, you just wasted everyone's time. Had a bad day, eh?

Funnily enough that's the useful response. This would be a much more useful
list if instead of pouncing on non-experts with tangential rants people
simply offered a link or two, or said precisely what kind of test info is
needed. 

I have now seen these pages: 

http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/TestingInstallation 
http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/AskingAboutIntegrations

I'll try them and check if SA is picking up the local.cf at all. 

Meanwhile, one specific question: where in Linux (with Exim) is spamd
started? I did a ""spamd --help"" and noticed that I can also specifically
assign a configuration file during startup. I'd like to try that, but
haven't found the Exim specifics. 

Thanks.

I'm happy to announce the first release of Clone Digger tool (1.0-beta).

Some background on software clones
======================
Two continuous fragments of code form clone if they are similar enough.
The presence of clones can greatly increase the software maintenance
cost. For instance, every error in the original have to be fixed in
all copies.

What is it
======================
Clone Digger is the tool for finding software clones (duplicate code)
in programs.
Currently Python language is supported, Java support will be added later.
The following definition of clone is used: two sequences of statements
form clone if one of it can be obtained from the other by replacing some
subtrees of its abstract syntax tree by other subtrees.
Found clone candidates are reported to the HTML with a highlighting of
differences.
This report can be used to form recommendations for refactoring.

License
======================
Clone Digger is provided under the GPL license.

Links
======================
Project site: http://clonedigger.sourceforge.net
Download: http://clonedigger.sourceforge.net/download.html
Clone Digger was tested on Python 2.4 and 2.5.

To my knowledge Clone Digger is the first tool that finds software
clones in Python sources (excluding tools working on the pure text
level). I hope that Clone Digger will be very useful for the Python
community.

p.s.
Clone Digger participates in the Google Summer of Code 2008 program. I
am looking for a student willing to work on code analysis and
refactoring. The project ideas are listed here:
http://clonedigger.sourceforge.net/google_summer_of_code.html

1.0-beta - the tool for finding software clones in Python

As I understand it, ADSL runs over telephone wires,
and if you have a telephone wire you have to pay someone line rental.

I have Eircom broadband, and consider it the most reliable 
and the most expensive.
Getting broadband can cause nervous breakdowns,
as most broadband companies spend 99% of their funds on advertising,
and 1% on help lines which are based in India, cost premium rates
and are permanently engaged.

If I didn't live in an NTL-free zone I would try cable.

Also I see WiFi broadband devices sold cheaply (60 euro?)
at PowerCity and elsewhere which seem to include 3 months connection.
I don't know if one has to sign something to promise to use it for ever?
Can one just dump it after the 3 month period if you want?

Overview
--------
Machine Learning is a foundational discipline of the Information
Sciences, concerned with the design and development of algorithms
and techniques that allow computers to ""learn"".

Topics will be covered in 9-10 lectures a 6 hours taught by world
experts in their fields. The aim of the summer school is to cover
the entire spectrum from theoretical foundations to practical
applications. In addition, there will be practical ""lab"" sessions,
where students will have the chance to implement methods for
themselves.

This school is suitable for all levels, both for people without
previous knowledge in Machine Learning, and those wishing to broaden
their expertise in this area. It will allow the participants to get
in touch with international experts in this field. Exchange of
students, joint publications and joint projects will result because
of this collaboration.

Material is directed both at outstanding participants without
previous knowledge in machine learning, and at those wishing to
broaden their expertise in the area; this includes PhD, Masters, and
advanced undergraduate students, postdocs, academics, and IT
professionals. The MLSS also provides an excellent opportunity for
interaction with top researchers in a broad cross-section of machine
learning disciplines.

of all applicants.

Venue
-----
The summer school will be held on Kioloa Coastal Campus, 200km south
of Sydney and 200km east of Canberra on the NSW south coast. The
unique blend of living history and modern technology underlies the
atmosphere of the Campus. Kioloa Coastal Campus has become the
premier research field station on the South Coast. With a mild
climate and unspoiled beach frontage, the Campus provides an ideal
break from normal campus and work environments.

true?

So far DomainKeys has not helped from what I can tell.

Yahoo is deferring the message as soon as my server connects, so it never even gets a chance to see the DomainKeys header.
